	  1) set the COMPONENT attribute on all cmake install commands.
	  COMPONENT names are according to

	* src/osgPlugins/CMakeLists.txt, src/osgPlugins/bvh,
	  src/osgPlugins/bvh/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/osgPlugins/bvh/ReaderWriterBVH.cpp: From Wang Rui,
	  "Attachment is a plugin reading Biovision hierarchical files
	  (.BVH) to generate character motion animations. BVH format is
	  widely used by Character Studio of 3dsmax, MotionBuilder and
	  other softwares, also supported by most motion capture devices.
	  The plugin is based on the latest osgAnimation library of OSG
	  2.7.6 and will return a osgAnimation::AnimationManager pointer if
	  using readNodeFile() to load it.
	  
	  Source and CMake files are:
	  
	  CMakeLists.txt
	  ReaderWriterBVH.cpp
	  
	  Also there are 3 example BVH files. The first two are captured
	  from motions of human beings - maybe a kung-fu master here.
	  PLEASE use command below to see the results:
	  
	  # osgviewer example1.bvh -O solids
	  
	  This will demonstrate the animating of a skeleton and render
	  bones as solid boxes. Note that the motion assumes XOZ is the
	  ground and has an offset from the center, so we should adjust our
	  view to get best effects.
	  
	  You may also use "-O contours" to render bones as lines. The
	  viewer shows nothing if without any options because
	  osgAnimation::Bone does not render itself. User may add
	  customized models to each named bones as osganimationskinning
	  does to make uses of this plugin in their own applications.
	  
	  I was wondering to support a BvhNode in my osgModeling peoject
	  before, but soon found it better be a plugin for animation. A
	  problem is, how to bind real geometry models to the skeleton.
	  Maybe we could have a bindingToNode() visitor in future to find
	  geodes matching names of bones and add them as bones' children."

	* src/osgWrappers/osg/BufferObject.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osg/Image.cpp: Updated wrappers

2008-12-01 13:28  robert

	* include/osg/BufferObject, src/osg/BufferObject.cpp: From Art
	  Tevs, "here is a submission of an additional class of
	  PixelBufferObejct, which implements more general way of handling
	  with PBOs. Current osg implementation of PBO does use an attached
	  osg::Image to copy data from. This is somehow only one way of
	  using it and doesn't provide full functionality of PBOs.
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  Descripton:
	  
	  The patch does provide a new class PixelDataBufferObject which is
	  capable of allocating memory on the GPU side (PBO memory) of
	  arbitrary size. The memory can then further be used to be enabled
	  into read mode (GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER_ARB) or in write mode
	  (GL_PIXEL_PACK_BUFFER_ARB). Enabling the buffer into write mode
	  will force the driver to write data from bounded textures into
	  that buffer (i.e. glGetTexImage). Using buffer in read mode give
	  you the possibility to read data from the buffer into a texture
	  with e.g. glTexSubImage or other instuctions. Hence no data is
	  copied over the CPU (host memory), all the operations are done in
	  the GPU memory.
	  
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  Compatibility:
	  
	  The new class require the unbindBuffer method from the base class
	  BufferObject to be virtual, which shouldn't break any
	  functionality of already existing classes. Except of this the new
	  class is fully orthogonal to existing one, hence can be safely
	  added into already existing osg system.
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  Testing:
	  
	  The new class was tested in the current svn version of osgPPU. I
	  am using the new class to copy data from textures into the PBO
	  and hence provide them to CUDA kernels. Also reading the results
	  back from CUDA is implemented using the provided patch. The given
	  patch gives a possibility of easy interoperability between CUDA
	  and osg (osgPPU ;) )
	  
	  
	  --------------------------------------------
	  I think in general it is a better way to derive the
	  PixelBufferObject class from PixelDataBufferObject, since the
	  second one is a generalization of the first one. However this
	  could break the current functionality, hence I haven't
	  implemented it in such a way. However I would push that on a
	  stack of wished osg 3.x features, since this will reflect the
	  OpenGL PBO functionality through the classes better.

	* include/osg/BoundingBox, include/osg/BoundingSphere,

	  versions of BoundingBox and BoundingSphere are useful for doing
	  computations in world coordinates, especially when working with a
	  geocentric scene. By default, these classes are built using
	  floats, so templated versions fill a need. I've used the double

2008-11-26 12:50  robert

	* src/osg/Sequence.cpp: From Andy Preece,
	  
	  "To reproduce the bug:
	  
	  1. Create a template osg::Sequence node (and underlying geometry)
	  but do not attach the node to the current active scenegraph.
	  2. At some point during the rendering loop (perhaps on a
	  keystroke) clone the sequence node (I use the call:
	  
	  dynamic_cast<osg::Node*>(templateNode -> clone( osg::CopyOp(
	  (osg::CopyOp::CopyFlags)osg::CopyOp::DEEP_COPY_NODES ) ) )
	  
	  3. Set the cloned sequence node duration to a value that makes
	  the animation run slower (i.e. 2.0).
	  4. Start the cloned sequence (using setMode()).
	  5. Repeat steps 2 \u2013 4 and observe that the cloned sequences
	  do not run slow but run as fast, appearing to ignore the duration
	  that has been set on them.
	  
	  
	  
	  Looking at the \u2018good documentation\u2019 (2.4 source code),
	  I see that _start is being set to _now (osg::Sequence::setMode(),
	  line 192). Should this not _start not be set to -1.0?"

	* CMakeLists.txt, CMakeModules/FindOpenEXR.cmake: Added searching

	* src/osgPlugins/CMakeLists.txt, src/osgPlugins/exr,
	  src/osgPlugins/exr/CMakeLists.txt,
	  src/osgPlugins/exr/ReaderWriterEXR.cpp: From Ragnar Hammarqvist,
	  "I wrote an EXR image plug-in to osg, I would like to contribute
	  this plug-in to the osg project if you find it useful.
	  
	  The plug-in is a wrapper around open-exr (http://www.openexr.com)
	  that consists of two projects, ilmbase-1.0.1 and openexr-1.6.1.
	  
	  I have only tested it on windows XP 32 machine. So there might be
	  some work making it work on other platforms.
	  
	  The plug-in supports writing and reading EXR files. When writing
	  it can use the data type GL_HALF_FLOAT_ARB(se ilmbase-1.0.1) and
	  GL_FLOAT. When reading the data type always becomes
	  GL_HALF_FLOAT_ARB. It supports textures with three and four
	  channels.
	  
	  When reading an exr file it automatically removes Alfa channel if
	  it didn't store any information."
	  
	  --
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, started work on ported it to other
	  platforms, but could fix some problems relating to error:
	  
	  ?Imf::OStream::OStream(const Imf::OStream&)? is private
	  
	  I'm checking in now so that others can have a bash at completing
	  the port.

	  GDAL_DIR.
	  
	  Also, I've modified the FindCOLLADA.cmake to locate the current
	  2.1 versions of the COLLADA DOM in the build directories under
	  VC8. I've also added a COLLADA_LIBRARY_DEBUG spec. Other flavors
	  may be added depending on compiler version and DOM version."

2008-11-26 11:45  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/stl/ReaderWriterSTL.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osgDB/DatabasePager.cpp: From BjornHein,
	  "attached a proposal for an extension for the the stl-File
	  ReaderWriter. It allows saving of an osg node tree as stl file in
	  ASCII-Format.
	  
	  Standard is to generate one stl file.
	  
	  With an additional option it is possible to write one file per
	  Geode. This option is not very "useful" for typical application,
	  I use it for separating and conversion of geometric data. So it
	  could be removed if considered to special."

	  are another fixes for using packed depth+stencil (PDS).
	  
	  * When used PDS RenderStage::runCameraSetUp sets flag that FBO
	  has already stencil,depth buffer attached. Prevents adding next
	  depth buffer.
	  * Sets correct traits for p-buffer if used PDS and something goes
	  wrong with FBO setup or p-buffer is used directly.
	  * Adds warning to camera if user add depth/stencil already
	  attached through PDS.
	  * Sets blitMask when use blit to resolve buffer.
	  
	  There is also new example with using multisampled FBO."

2008-11-24 16:32  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt, include/osg/Export, src/osg/Config.in: From
	  Wojciech Lewandowski, "I have restored MSVC disabled warnings in
	  osg/Export. Difference is they are now disabled only when
	  OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS macro is defined. This macro is set
	  through CMake options and autogenerated in osg/Config. Simon
	  suggested that it would be cool if we had more control over
	  selected warnings. I tried to learn how to make selection of
	  individual warning numbers possible, but had to gave up as my
	  cmake skills were not sufficient. The only way I saw this
	  possible would be adding one define for each MSVC warning number.
	  But many definitions seemed too be to much clutter for osg/Config
	  file so I rejected thar idea. For this it would be cool if
	  autogenerated Config entries could more powerful than simple
	  #define/#undef flags. Maybe Cmake gurus know how to do it.
	  
	  I have not reverted added Compiler options. I assume that one may
	  want to have warnings enabled for the application but may not
	  want to see them while OSG libraries and examples compile.
	  
	  Modified files:
	  
	  osg/Export - now explicitly includes osg/Config to make sure
	  OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS is read
	  osg/Config.in - declares OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS flag to be
	  added to autogenerated osg/Config
	  CMakeLists.txt - declares OSG_DISABLE_MSVC_WARNINGS as option
	  with default ON setting
	  "

2008-11-24 16:26  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/dds/ReaderWriterDDS.cpp: From Marco Jez, "The DDS
	  plugin currently prints too many NOTICE messages that, given

2008-11-24 16:09  robert

	  reads the .bsp file itself, and the other ("vtf") reads the

	  The set up for this to work is a bit more complex than most

	  After taking a look at the current state of the BMP loader I
	  decided it might be worth a shot at reimplementing that part. For
	  example: the current loader doesn't properly handle 1- and 4-bit
	  files, incorrectly loads 16-bit files as intensity-alpha (they
	  are RGB555), is full of dead code, and generally not in very good
	  shape.
	  
	  Attached is my re-implementation for review.
	  
	  I've checked it against the test images from
	  http://wvnvaxa.wvnet.edu/vmswww/bmp.html and models that use BMP
	  files.

	* src/osgViewer/CompositeViewer.cpp: From Danny Valente, submitted
	  bu Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Some context: In the past I submitted a
	  fix to osgViewer::CompositeViewer where events would get wrong
	  input ranges. Later, you made a change to set the eventState's
	  current graphics context to the current graphics context.
	  However, there's a problem in the sequence of events. Here's the
	  recap (doing a graphical diff with the attached file will show
	  this clearly):
	  
	  Before:
	  
	  1. if the camera is not a slave camera
	  1.1 set the eventState's graphics context to the current context.
	  2. if the current master view is not the view which has the focus
	  2.1 set the current master view to be the view which has the
	  focus
	  2.2 use the new master view's eventState instead of the old one
	  
	  Now as you can see from this sequence, the graphics context is
	  set on the eventState before switching to the view which has
	  focus (and thus using another eventState). So the new eventState,
	  in the case we need to switch views, will contain an old graphics
	  context, not the correct one.
	  
	  Just inversing these steps fixes the problem:
	  
	  1. if the current master view is not the view which has the focus
	  1.1 set the current master view to be the view which has the
	  focus
	  1.2 use the new master view's eventState instead of the old one
	  2. if the camera is not a slave camera
	  2.1 set the eventState's graphics context to the current context.
	  
	  Now, the eventState will refer to the correct graphics context in
	  both cases.
	  
	  Attached is a fixed CompositeViewer.cpp (based on today's SVN)
	  which does this. Note that some other things are done in the 1.
	  and 2. cases, but they have no influence on each other so they
	  can just be swapped without problems.

	* src/osgViewer/StatsHandler.cpp: From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I am
	  sending a really minor fix for StatsHandler::reset method. We
	  dynamically add and remove slave cameras in our application.
	  StatsHandler does not automatically adapt to this situation, and
	  we call StatsHandler::reset to force it to update number of
	  cameras and their graphs. Unfortunately, if stats were already
	  drawn, reset would not remove former graph drawables and they
	  would remain frozen below new stats. This update fixes it.

	* src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/expPrimaryRecords.cpp: From Katharina
	  Plugge, "I found a bug in the OpenFlight-Plugin. When exporting
	  to OpenFlight it could happen that palettes of an external
	  reference like the texture palette are set wrong, because they
	  are overwritten by parent settings (userData), which actually do
	  not refer to palette entries respectively ParentPools (happens
	  for example if a Transform is parent of a ProxyNode). The static
	  cast from userData to ParentPools should therefore be a dynamic
	  cast.
	  ---------------------------

	* src/osgPlugins/ac/ac3d.cpp: From Mathias Froehlich, "This change
	  is a result of a recent thread on osg-users.
	  The semantic change that went into the ac loader with the past

	  incorrect wrt the document describing the behaviour of ac files

	  src/OpenThreads/common/Config.in,
	  src/OpenThreads/win32/Win32BarrierPrivateData.h,

	  Czink, "Among other things I added support for atomic operations
	  on BSD-like systems and additional methods (for "and", "or",
	  "xor").
	  "
	  
	  and a later post the same osg-submissions thread:
	  
	  "it's been a while since I have made the changes but I think it
	  was due to problems with static builds of OpenThreads on windows.
	  I was using
	  OpenThreads in a communication/synchronisation library (without
	  OpenSceneGraph). It seems I forgot to post a small change in the
	  CMakeLists file of OpenThreads. If a user turns
	  DYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS to OFF (static build) OT_LIBRARY_STATIC will
	  be defined in the Config.
	  Without these changes a windows user will always end up with a
	  "__declspec(dllexport)" or "__declspec(dllimport)" which is a
	  problem for static builds."
	  
	  And another post from Blasius on this topic:
	  
	  "I tested with VS2005 and VS2008. For 32 bit everything works as
	  expected. For x64 and VS2008 I could successfully do the
	  cmake-configure and then the compilation but I had occasional
	  crashes of cmTryCompileExec.exe (during the cmake-configure
	  phase) which seems to be a cmake bug. With VS2005 and 64bit cmake
	  does not set _OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED although
	  the interlocked functionality should be there. If I place the
	  source snippet from the CHECK_CXX_SOURCE_RUNS macro to a separate
	  sourcefile I can compile and run the resulting executable
	  successfully. Forcing OPENTHREADS_ATOMIC_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED
	  (on VS2005/x64) reveals a bug in "intrin.h" which seems to be
	  fixed in VS2008 but not in VS2005.
	  
	  In case anyone is interested the lines:
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset(long *a, long
	  b))
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset(long *a,
	  long b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset64(__int64
	  *a, __int64 b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset64(__int64
	  *a, __int64 b))
	  
	  should be changed to:
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset(long volatile
	  *a, long b))
	  __MACHINEI(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset(long
	  volatile *a, long b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandset64(__int64
	  volatile *a, __int64 b))
	  __MACHINEX64(unsigned char _interlockedbittestandreset64(__int64
	  volatile *a, __int64 b))
	  
	  The worst thing that can happen is that interlocked funtionality
	  is not detected during cmake-configure and the mutex fallback is
	  used.
	  Which reminds me another small glitch in the Atomic header so I
	  attached a corrected version.
	  
	  
	  
	  Why is the OT_LIBRARY_STATIC added to the config file? It is not
	  needed anywhere.
	  
	  OT_LIBRARY_STATIC is needed if you are doing static-builds on
	  Windows. See my previous post on that.

	  - Matrix transform nodes were stripped out, and the

	* src/osgPlugins/dae/daeWTransforms.cpp: From Panagiotis
	  Koutsourakis, "We are using Open Scene Graph for an application
	  and we need COLLADA
	  support. While testing the pluggin we found a small bug and we
	  are
	  submitting a patch.
	  
	  The first attachment is a small program that creates a scene with
	  two
	  pyramids, transformed by two instances of
	  osg::PositionAttitudeTransform. One of them is rotated 90 degrees
	  in
	  the X axis, and the scene is exported both in the native OSG
	  (.osg)
	  and COLLADA (.dae) formats. In the first case the rotated pyramid
	  is
	  displayed correctly whereas in the second the pyramid seems not
	  to be
	  rotated.
	  
	  In the COLLADA 1.4.1 specification (found at
	  http://www.khronos.org/collada/) it is specified that
	  "The <rotate> element contains a list of four floating-point
	  values
	  [...] followed by an angle in degrees" but the plugin seems to
	  write
	  the value in radians.
	  
	  The problem seems to be in the method daeWriter::apply() that
	  seems to
	  be writing the angle value in radians to the COLLADA file. The
	  patch
	  can be found in the second attachment and is simply a call to
	  RadiansToDegrees wrapped around the angle.

	* src/osgShadow/StandardShadowMap.cpp: From Wojciech Lewandowski,

	  shadows."

	* src/osgGA/UFOManipulator.cpp: From Chris Denham, "However, just
	  spotted another inconsistency between UFOManipulator::getMatrix()
	  and UFOManipulator::getInverseMatrix()
	  It assumes that inverse(_inverseMatrix * _offset) = _offset *
	  _matrix
	  This is only true when _offset=identity, so I think it should be
	  inverse(_offset) * _matrix
	  This inconsistency can cause problems when switching from UFO to
	  other manipulators, because the UFO:Manipulator::getMatrix
	  function is not necessarily returning a correct inverse of the
	  currently set ModelViewTransform.
	  It was tempting to change the name of the _offset member to
	  _inverseOffset, or to maintain both variables, but in the end
	  went for the minimal change."

2008-10-07 13:37  robert

	* src/osgViewer/StatsHandler.cpp: From Jean-Sebastirn Guay,
	  "Inspired by the latest additions to the StatsHandler, here is my
	  own addition. It's a graph that helps show the variation of the
	  various stats over time. It's clearer than just having bars for
	  the last 10 frames or so, IMHO, since 10 frames go by pretty
	  fast...
	  
	  The graph is displayed "under" (behind) the normal bar chart you
	  get when you press 's' twice. It doesn't hide the normal stats,
	  you can still read them without any trouble, and that way, it
	  doesn't take any more screen space. It starts from the left, and
	  will scroll left when there is enough data to fill the screen
	  width. The graph lines have the same colors we're used to (except
	  I made the event color a bit bluer, so it's not exactly the same
	  as the update color). A screen shot is attached.
	  
	  The lines get a bit confused when they're all overlapping at the
	  bottom of the graph, but I think that's the least of our concerns
	  (if they're all at the bottom of the graph - except FPS of course
	  - then great!).
	  
	  The only thing I'm not very keen about is that to make things
	  simple, I clamp the values to a given maximum. Right now, the
	  maximums I have set are:
	  
	  * Frame rate: 100 fps (people have 60, 75, 85Hz refresh rates, so
	  there's no one right value, but I think 100 is OK)
	  * Stats: 0.016 seconds (what you need to get 60Hz minimum)
	  
	  This could be changed so that the scale of the graph changes
	  according to the maximum value in the last screenful of the graph
	  instead of clamping values. We would then need to display the
	  scale for each value on the side of the graph, because if the
	  scale changes, you need to know what it is at this moment.
	  
	  I tried to make things easy to change, so for example if you
	  don't like that the graph is in the same space as the normal
	  stats bars, it's easy to move it anywhere else, and make it have
	  other dimensions. The maximums and colors are also easy to
	  change.
	  
	  The impact on performance should be minimal, since it's one
	  vertex per graph line that's added per frame, and vertices are
	  removed when they scroll off the screen, so you'll never have
	  more than say 1280 * (3 + ncameras) vertices on the screen at one
	  time. No polygons, I used line strips. The scrolling is done with
	  a MatrixTransform."

	* src/osg/OcclusionQueryNode.cpp: From Paul Martz, "I had to make

	  Please include this on the trunk"

	* include/osg/ref_ptr: From Neil Groves, "Frequently I would like
	  code that has a signature like: void foo(osg::ref_ptr<osg::Node>
	  node) to work for osg::ref_ptr<osg::Group>,
	  osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geode> etc. The behaviour of osg::ref_ptr does
	  not mimic the behaviour of a raw pointer in this regard.
	  
	  To facilitate this possibility I have added a template copy
	  constructor and a template assignment operator. These work for
	  safe conversions like those in my previous example, but fail as
	  desired for non-safe conversions since the template instantiation
	  fails during the raw pointer copy/assignment.
	  
	  The lack of this facility has appreciably handicapped development
	  of generic algorithms applied to the scene graph, and I believe
	  that this alteration will be welcomed by most of the community.
	  If there are issues with antiquated compilers not supporting
	  template member functions then perhaps a small piece of
	  conditional compilation is in order.
	  
	  I have made the change using the latest release version (2.6) as
	  the base. The full file is attached.
	  
	  I have not tested building the osg wrappers and the script
	  binding code. I have tested the legal and illegal conversions of
	  both copying and assignment to ensure that behave as expected on
	  MSVC7.1, MSVC8, MSVC9, GCC 4.3."

2008-10-03 09:22  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/quicktime/ReaderWriterQT.cpp: From Tatsuhiro
	  Nishioka, submissions posted by Stephan Huber, "attached you'll
	  find a modified ReaderWriterQT.cpp-file where I removed the
	  support for rgb(a)-files.
	  Quicktime supports only files with 3/4-channels rgba-files and
	  not 1/2-channels rgb-files.
	  
	  This submission is from Tatsuhiro Nishioka, here's his original
	  quote:
	  
	  When FlightGear crashes, the error message
	  "GraphicsImportGetNaturalBounds failed" shows up. By adding
	  printf
	  debug, I found the error was -8969: codecBadDataErr when loading
	  a
	  gray-scaled (2 channels) rgba files even though the file can be
	  loaded
	  with Gimp and osgViewer properly.
	  
	  So I made an investigation on this problem and found an
	  interesting
	  thing. This error occurs only when non-rgb files are loaded
	  before rgb
	  files. The reason is that rgba files can be handled by both
	  osgdb_rgb.so and osgdb_qt.so, but the error happens only when
	  osgdb_qt.so try to load a gray-scaled rgba file.
	  
	  When a program is about to load an rgba file, osgdb_rgb.so is
	  loaded
	  and it handles the rgba file properly. In contrast, when a
	  gray-scaled
	  rgb file is being loaded after a non-rgb file (say png) is
	  already
	  loaded by osgdb_qt.so, osgdb_qt.so tries to load the file instead
	  of
	  osgdb_rgb, which causes the error above.
	  
	  Anyway, the bad thing is that QuickTime cannot handle gray-scaled
	  rgb
	  files properly. The solution for this is not to let osgdb_qt
	  handle
	  rgb files since osgdb_rgb can handle these properly.

	  Stephan Maximilian Huber sent in a submission with enhanced

	  his submission I tried to merge his changes with the current CVS
	  head. I made a few changes to the way the statistics are
	  displayed. Attached you will find the new StatsHandler and a
	  screenshot of the statistics in the compositeviewer example.
	  
	  This code will add two extra statistics options:
	  -Camera scene statistics, stats for the scene after culling
	  (updated at 10 Hz)
	  -View scene statistics, stats for the complete scene (updated at
	  5 Hz)
	  
	  Each camera and each view will expand the statistics to the
	  right.
	  
	  I also added the requests and objects to compile of the
	  databasepager to the databasepager statistics.""

2008-09-18 13:05  robert

	* src/osgShadow/ShadowMap.cpp: From Chris Denham, "
	  I think I may have discovered a bug in osgShadow/ShadowMap.cpp
	  that results in incomplete shadows being generated.
	  The problem seems to caused by an incorrect interpretation of the
	  spot light cutoff angle. The valid ranges for spot cutoff are
	  0-90 and 180, i.e half the 'field of view' for the spotlight.
	  Whereas the shadow map code seems to assume the the spot cutoff
	  is equal to the field of view. This results in the shadows
	  generated by the spotlight getting clipped at half the spot
	  cutoff angle.
	  
	  I have fixed this in my copy of ShadowMap.cpp:
	  ===============================
	  //Original code from OSG 2.6:
	  if(selectLight->getSpotCutoff() < 180.0f) // spotlight, then we
	  don't need the bounding box
	  {
	  osg::Vec3 position(lightpos.x(), lightpos.y(), lightpos.z());
	  float spotAngle = selectLight->getSpotCutoff();
	  _camera->setProjectionMatrixAsPerspective(spotAngle, 1.0, 0.1,
	  1000.0);
	  
	  _camera->setViewMatrixAsLookAt(position,position+lightDir,osg::Vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
	  }
	  ===============================
	  // My modifications:
	  float fov = selectLight->getSpotCutoff() * 2;
	  if(fov < 180.0f) // spotlight, then we don't need the bounding
	  box
	  {
	  osg::Vec3 position(lightpos.x(), lightpos.y(), lightpos.z());
	  _camera->setProjectionMatrixAsPerspective(fov, 1.0, 0.1, 1000.0);
	  
	  _camera->setViewMatrixAsLookAt(position,position+lightDir,osg::Vec3(0.0f,1.0f,0.0f));
	  }
	  
	  This change seems correct for spot cutoff in the range 0, 90, but
	  since OpenGL doesn't claim to support cutoffs >90 && <180, I'm
	  not sure how shadow map should deal with those cases, but
	  ignoring spot cut off greater than 90 here seems reasonable to
	  me.

	* CMakeLists.txt, src/osgDB/Registry.cpp: From Alberto Luaces,
	  "Cygwin's cmake build adds a "d" postfix to the plugins installed
	  in debug

	  problems with
	  debug versions of the library not being able to open their
	  plugins whereas
	  the release versions worked fine.
	  
	  I have made the same changes in Registry.cpp that are available
	  for the rest
	  of platforms appending that "d" to their plugins. I have also
	  updated the
	  CMakeLists.txt file to get "_DEBUG" defined at compilation time.
	  I have
	  copied the already existent conditional block because of cmake's
	  bizarre
	  operator precedence. Since Cygwin defines both CYGWIN and WIN32,
	  the
	  following would suffice:
	  
	  IF(CYGWIN OR UNIX AND NOT WIN32 AND NOT APPLE)
	  
	  Sadly, it actually doesn't work, so I wrote a new conditional
	  block just for
	  Cygwin. I could join the two blocks when the parentheses support
	  is added in
	  newer versions of cmake."

	* src/osgShadow/ParallelSplitShadowMap.cpp: From Adrian Egli, "i
	  came around reviewing my code, and found now finally a solution
	  to remove the polygon offset issue. as we all know the polygon
	  offset has a different behaviour on different GPU system (ATI,
	  NVidia) and this make the use of
	  polygon offset complicate. so i looked for a solution to remove
	  this offset.
	  
	  i changed the shader, also the filtering (default: on) use now a
	  correct 3x3 filter:
	  1 0 1
	  0 2 0
	  1 0 1
	  
	  div: 6
	  
	  of course a better one would be
	  1 2 1
	  2 4 2
	  1 2 1
	  
	  div: 16
	  but this isn't as performant as the simple filter above is.
	  because we need only 5 texture lookups instead of 9, and the
	  result is still good, if you wish we can add a enum to change the
	  pcf filter type once, if there is a need.

	* examples/osggeometryshaders/osggeometryshaders.cpp: From
	  Christophe Loustaunau,"
	  I have found some errors on the example osgGeometryShaders. It's
	  about the varying in the geometry shader.
	  take a look at the varying vec4 v_color.
	  In the vertex shader, v_color is initialized to gl_vertex
	  then in the geometry shader v_color is initialized to
	  gl_PositionIn[0]
	  and in the fragment shader v_color is used as the fragment color.
	  
	  Try to initialized v_color to vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) in the
	  vertex shader and comment the line :
	  " v_color = v;\n" in the geometry shader, and you will see the
	  lines as black !
	  
	  It's because you have to use keywords in and out.
	  
	  extract from :
	  http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/geometry_shader4.txt :
	  
	  in - for function parameters passed into a function or for input
	  varying
	  variables (geometry only)
	  
	  out - for function parameters passed back out of a function, but
	  not
	  initialized for use when passed in. Also for output varying
	  variables
	  (geometry only).
	  
	  Then for a geometry shader, a varying must be an array :
	  extract from :
	  http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/geometry_shader4.txt :
	  
	  Since a geometry shader operates on primitives, each input
	  varying variable needs to be
	  declared as an array. Each element of such an array corresponds
	  to a
	  vertex of the primitive being processed. If the varying variable
	  is
	  declared as a scalar or matrix in the vertex shader, it will be a
	  one-dimensional array in the geometry shader. Each array can
	  optionally
	  have a size declared. If a size is not specified, it inferred by
	  the
	  linker and depends on the value of the input primitive type.
	  
	  
	  Here is a patch based on the svn version of osg that correct
	  that.

	* src/osgWidget/WindowManager.cpp: From Max Bandazian, "Lines

	  src/osgUtil/SceneGraphBuilder.cpp, src/osgViewer/View.cpp: From
	  Mathias Froehlich, "This is a generic optimization that does not
	  depend on any cpu or instruction
	  set.
	  
	  The optimization is based on the observation that matrix matrix
	  multiplication
	  with a dense matrix 4x4 is 4^3 Operations whereas multiplication
	  with a
	  transform, or scale matrix is only 4^2 operations. Which is a
	  gain of a
	  *FACTOR*4* for these special cases.
	  The change implements these special cases, provides a unit test
	  for these
	  implementation and converts uses of the expensiver dense matrix
	  matrix
	  routine with the specialized versions.
	  
	  Depending on the transform nodes in the scenegraph this change
	  gives a
	  noticable improovement.
	  For example the osgforest code using the MatrixTransform is about
	  20% slower
	  than the same codepath using the PositionAttitudeTransform
	  instead of the
	  MatrixTransform with this patch applied.
	  
	  If I remember right, the sse type optimizations did *not* provide
	  a factor 4
	  improovement. Also these changes are totally independent of any
	  cpu or
	  instruction set architecture. So I would prefer to have this
	  current kind of
	  change instead of some hand coded and cpu dependent assembly
	  stuff. If we
	  need that hand tuned stuff, these can go on top of this changes
	  which must
	  provide than hand optimized additional variants for the
	  specialized versions
	  to give a even better result in the end.
	  
	  An other change included here is a change to rotation matrix from
	  quaterion
	  code. There is a sqrt call which couold be optimized away. Since
	  we divide in
	  effect by sqrt(length)*sqrt(length) which is just length ...

2008-08-25 16:43  robert

	* src/osg/OcclusionQueryNode.cpp: From Doug McCorkle, via Paul
	  Martz who writes : "Summary: Some platforms/configurations cause
	  application crashes if the
	  occlusion query result is not ready for retrieval when the app
	  tries to
	  retrieve it. This fix adds an application-level wait loop to
	  ensure the
	  result is ready for retrieval. This code is not compiled by
	  default; add "-D
	  FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to get this code.
	  
	  Full, gory details, to the best of my recollection:
	  
	  The conditions under which we encountered this issue are as
	  follows: 64-bit
	  processor, Mac/Linux OS, multiple NVIDIA GPUs, multiple
	  concurrent draw
	  threads, VRJuggler/SceneView-based viewer, and a scene graph
	  containing
	  OcclusionQueryNodes. Todd wrote a small test program that
	  produces an almost
	  instant crash in this environment. We verified the crash does not
	  occur in a
	  similar environment with a 32-bit processor, but we have not yet
	  tested on
	  Windows and have not yet tested with osgViewer.
	  
	  The OpenGL spec states clearly that, if an occlusion query result
	  is not yet
	  ready, an app can go ahead and attempt to retrieve it, and OpenGL
	  will
	  simply block until the result is ready. Indeed, this is how
	  OcclusionQueryNode is written, and this has worked fine on
	  several platforms
	  and configurations until Todd's test program.
	  
	  By trial and error and dumb luck, we were able to workaround the
	  crash by
	  inserting a wait loop that forces the app to only retrieve the
	  query after
	  OpenGL says it is available. As this should not be required
	  (OpenGL should
	  do this implicitly, and more efficiently), the wait loop code is
	  not
	  compiled by default. Developers requiring this work around must
	  explicitly
	  add "-D FORCE_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE_BEFORE_RETRIEVAL" to the
	  compile
	  options to include the wait loop."

2008-08-18 11:21  robert

	* include/osgWidget/StyleManager, src/osgWidget/StyleManager.cpp:
	  From Sergey Leontyev, "1. In StyleManager
	  
	  
	  
	  when applying styles to a Label element the code below runs in a
	  infinite loop.
	  
	  The reason for this is that nothing increments the Reader "r" in
	  the case when applying a style to label,
	  
	  so I advance the reader when no match was found.
	  
	  ( To replicate the error apply style to any label)
	  
	  
	  
	  replaced this:
	  
	  while(!r.eof()) if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r)) inc = true;
	  
	  
	  
	  with this:
	  
	  while(!r.eof())
	  
	  {
	  
	  if(_styles[style]->applyStyle(t, r))
	  
	  inc = true;

	  r.advanceOverCurrentFieldOrBlock();

	  I tested it and it works well for me, I did not find any problems
	  with it.
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  2. Added style support for Canvas element, event though there is
	  no styles to apply yet.
	  
	  It is usefull for someone who inherits from Canvas class to
	  develop another element.
	  
	  If applyStyle(Canvas) does not exist
	  
	  there is no way to apply style to the element that inherited from
	  Canvas element.
	  
	  
	  
	  Added virtual
	  
	  bool applyStyle(Canvas).
	  
	  
	  
	  and in added call to apply style if the Object is of type Canvas:
	  
	  StyleManager::_applyStyleToObject(osg::Object* obj, const
	  std::string& style) {
	  
	  ...

	  "I made several modifications:
	  
	  
	  
	  * The cause of my errors was that my OSG source directory path
	  contains spaces. To fix this issue I wrapped all paths with
	  quotes, as stated in doxygen documentation.
	  
	  
	  
	  * I also received some warning messages about deprecated doxygen
	  settings, which I fixed by updating the doxygen file, i.e.
	  running \u2018doxygen \u2013u doxygen.cmake\u2018. By running
	  this command deprecated doxygen options are removed, some option
	  comments have changed and quite some options have been added (I
	  kept their default settings unless mentioned).
	  
	  
	  
	  * I was surprised to find that the doxygen OUTPUT_DIRECTORY was
	  set to \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_SOURCE_DIR}/doc\u201d, which does
	  not seem appropriate for out of source builds; I changed this to
	  \u201c${OpenSceneGraph_BINARY_DIR}/doc\u201d. (On the other hand,
	  maybe a cmake selectable option should be given to the user?)
	  
	  
	  
	  * Fixed two warnings I received about unexpected
	  end-of-list-markers in \u2018osg\AnimationPath and
	  \u2018osgUtil\CullVisitor due to excess trailing points in
	  comments.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Fixed a warning in osgWidget\StyleInterface due to an #include
	  directive (strangely) placed inside a namespace.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Fixed a warning in osg\Camera due to the META_Object macro that
	  confused doxygen. Adding a semi-colon fixed this.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Removed auto_Mainpage from the INCLUDE option, because I am
	  positive that this file does not belong there; It never generated
	  useful documentation anyway.
	  
	  
	  
	  * I added the OSG version number environment variable to the
	  PROJECT_NUMBER option so that the version number is now shown on
	  the main page of generated documentation (e.g. index.html).
	  
	  
	  
	  * Changed option FULL_PATH_NAMES to YES, but made sure
	  STRIP_FROM_PATH stripped the absolute path until the include dir.
	  This fixed an issue that created mangled names for identical
	  filenames in different directories. E.g. osg/Export and
	  osgDB/Export are now correctly named.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Changed option SHOW_DIRECTORIES to yes, which is a case of
	  preference I guess.

	  Maceij Krol, "I have implement frame based expiration of PagedLOD
	  children.
	  
	  New attribute DatabasePager::_expiryFrames sets number of frames
	  a PagedLOD child is kept in memory. The attribute is set with
	  DatabasePager::setExpiryFrames method or OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES
	  environmental variable.
	  
	  New attribute PagedLOD::PerRangeData::_
	  frameNumber contains frame number of last cull traversal.
	  
	  Children of PagedLOD are expired when time _AND_ number of frames
	  since last cull traversal exceed OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY _AND_
	  OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES respectively. By default OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 1
	  which means that nodes from last cull/rendering
	  traversal will not be expired even if last cull time exceeds
	  OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY. Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES = 0 revokes previous
	  behaviour of PagedLOD.
	  
	  Setting OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES > 0 fixes problems of children
	  reloading in lazy rendering applications. Required behaviour is
	  achieved by manipulating OSG_EXPIRY_DELAY and OSG_EXPIRY_FRAMES
	  together.
	  
	  Two interface changes are made:
	  
	  DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(double currentFrameTime) is
	  replaced by DatabasePager::updateSceneGraph(const osg::FrameStamp
	  &frameStamp). The previous method is in #if 0 clause in the
	  header file. Robert, decide if You want to include it.
	  
	  PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double expiryTime, NodeList
	  &removedChildren) is deprecated (warning is printed), when
	  subclassing use PagedLOD::removeExpiredChildren(double
	  expiryTime, int expiryFrame, NodeList &removedChildren) instead.

	* applications/osgviewer/osgviewer.cpp,

	  src/osgViewer/ScreenCaptureHandler.cpp: From Jean-Sebastien Guay,
	  "Changes attached so that the CaptureOperation is passed in the
	  constructor of the ScreenCaptureHandler (default 0 = default
	  CaptureOperation). This way, you can do:
	  
	  viewer.addEventHandler(new osgViewer::ScreenCaptureHandler(
	  new osgViewer::WriteToFileCaptureOperation("filename", "jpg")));
	  
	  and the filename will be what you want. The
	  WriteToFileCaptureOperation will add the context ID and the file
	  number (if in SEQUENTIAL_NUMBER mode) to the file name.
	  
	  (The attached also clarifies some notify messages, and corrects
	  the comment when adding the handler in osgviewer.cpp)
	  
	  I also remembered, the current architecture could allow a
	  different CaptureOperation for each context, but currently the
	  API only allows setting one CaptureOperation for all contexts.
	  This could be improved if need be.

	* src/osgPlugins/obj/ReaderWriterOBJ.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/obj/obj.cpp: From Doug McCorkle, "Attached is
	  patch that corrects/improves the following issues with the OBJ
	  loader:
	  
	  1. Added options to control wether the osgUtil::Tessellator or
	  osgUtil::TriStripVisitor are run. By default they still run just
	  as before.
	  2. Added support for the Emissive material. The data was being
	  read from the mtl file but was never being applied to the model.
	  3. This is the main bug addressed, when a model is read in with
	  an alpha value specified like:
	  
	  newmtl Material__8
	  Ns 24
	  d 0.33
	  illum 2
	  Kd 0.204 0.204 0.204
	  Ks 0 0 0
	  Ka 0.153 0.153 0.153
	  
	  where the alpha value is d. The loader would then overwrite the
	  alpha value when reading the diffuse, specular, and ambient
	  colors. I have changed all the material color readers to only set
	  the values they read and to use the default colors specified in
	  the constructor of the obj class. With these changes, the obj
	  reader now handles opacity correctly if the alpha value is
	  specified before the material colo"

	  Simmonson,
	  "Opcodes.h:
	  * Added INVALID_OP as -1 in the Opcodes enum. Note that

	* CMakeModules/CheckAtomicOps.cmake, src/osg/Image.cpp: From
	  Mathias Froehlich, "Update to the configure check for msvc 7.1.
	  MemoryBarrier() is used in the implementation, so it should be
	  checked.
	  This in effect disables the faster atomic ops on msvc 7.1 and
	  older, even if
	  only the MemoryBarrier() call is missing. But it ensures for the
	  fist cut
	  that it will build everywhere. If somebody cares for msvc 7.1
	  enough and has
	  one for testing installed, he might provide the apropriate
	  defines to guard
	  that MemoryBarrier() call.
	  
	  I tested that msvc8 32/64bit still passes the configure tests and
	  compiles.

2008-06-27 12:44  robert

	* include/osg/MixinVector, include/osg/Shape: Simplified the

2008-06-26 18:34  robert

	* src/osgUtil/IntersectionVisitor.cpp: From Paul Martz, "The method
	  IntersectionVisitor::apply(osg::PagedLOD&) appears to attempt to
	  identify a "highest res" child of the PagedLOD and only allow
	  intersection on that child. The implementation appears to be
	  flawed in two cases:
	  
	  1) The "highest res" child is assumed to be the child with index
	  "getNumFileNames()-1" or "getNumChildren()-1". As a result,
	  PagedLODs that do not sort children from furthest to nearest will
	  intersect with the wrong child. (see attached "case1.osg" to
	  reproduce this problem.)
	  
	  2) The code assumes there is only one highest res child. As a
	  result. PagedLODs with multiple children at the same highest res
	  range can only intersect one of those children. ("case2.osg"
	  demonstrates this issue; you can only pick the quad on the
	  right.)
	  
	  I've attached a modified IntersectionVisitor.cpp that attempts to
	  resolve these issues. It identifies a highest res range based on
	  the range mode, then continues traversal on all valid children
	  corresponding to that range description. Only in the case of a
	  malformed PagedLOD does the code fall back to getting the last
	  child in the list.

	  cloning effects osg crashes because the copy constructur tries to
	  run av pure virtual method (setUpEmitterAndProgram). The right
	  thing to do when cloning an effect is to run the inherited
	  version og buildEffect and setUpEmitterAndProgram.
	  
	  "

2008-06-26 16:45  robert

	* src/osg/GraphicsContext.cpp: Changed the removeCamera() method so
	  that it now actively calls releaseGLObjects()
	  on all children of a camera that aren't shared with other cameras
	  on that context.
	  
	  This change fixes problems with allocating and deleting views.

2008-06-26 10:27  robert

	* CMakeModules/CheckAtomicOps.cmake, include/OpenThreads/Atomic,
	  include/osg/Referenced, src/OpenThreads/common/Atomic.cpp,
	  src/OpenThreads/pthreads/CMakeLists.txt, src/osg/Referenced.cpp:
	  From Mathias Froechlich, "Attached is a change to that atomic
	  stuff to move the win32, msvc
	  implementation of the atomic increment and decrement into a
	  implementation
	  file.
	  This way inlining and compiler optimization can no longer happen
	  for these
	  implementations, but it fixes compilation on win32 msvc targets.
	  I expect
	  that this is still faster than with with mutexes.
	  
	  Also the i386 gcc target gets atomic operations with this patch.
	  By using an

	  From Mathias Froehlich, "fixed win32/win64 configure check and
	  win32/win64
	  atomic related compile failures with msvs2005. Attached changes
	  to make win32

2008-06-23 11:14  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt: From Mathieu Marache, "Suibject: CMakeList
	  ADD_DEFINITION for CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX broken
	  I needed a -DCMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX="d" not a
	  -D"CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX=d".
	  
	  This corrects the build for the CMake 2.4 and 2.6 series
	  
	  The error was in compiling osgDB/Registry.cpp

2008-06-23 10:18  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt, src/OpenThreads/CMakeLists.txt: Commented out the

	  compiling on ppc and i386 for 10.5 and 10.4, and on Linux
	  (CentOS) and everything still seems to work ok. Here are the
	  changes I made (against OSG svn as of this afternoon):
	  
	  - Added osgviewerCocoa example to APPLE builds
	  - Fixed corrupt Xcode project generation with CMake 2.6 dealing

	* include/osg/Array, include/osg/MixinVector,
	  include/osg/PrimitiveSet: From Neil Groves,
	  
	  "I have taken the liberty of updating a few files so that there
	  is no longer any derivation from std::vector. I have done this by
	  adding a new file osg/MixinVector and by updating only two
	  others: osg/PrimitiveSet and osg/Array. You will notice that this
	  actually removes what is acknowledged as a \u2018hack\u2019 in
	  osg/PrimitiveSet.
	  
	  With the original code I did manage to find memory leaks with
	  some compiler options on VC 8 and 9, as well as Intel compiler. I
	  determined the leak existence by instrumenting the destructor
	  code, and by use of a garbage collector as a leak detector (in a
	  similar manner to the Firefox project). Hence in contrast to what
	  I said originally, it is exhibiting symptoms on at least some
	  platforms.
	  
	  Since I am trying to be a good OSG citizen I got out my editor
	  and started hacking! I have built and tested on Linux (Ubuntu)
	  with GCC 4.x and Windows VC 8 SP1. It appears that nothing is
	  broken, and that I\u2019m using less memory J"

	* src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/MaterialPaletteManager.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PaletteRecords.cpp: From Rudolf
	  Weidemann, "in the OpenFlight format materials can have editable
	  names.
	  In the OSG OpenFlight plugin these names are ignored when
	  reading, and
	  empty strings are written.
	  
	  As we need these names in the OSG scene graph by our application,
	  I
	  changed the plugin code, so the names are now stored in class
	  "osg::Material" (derived from "osg::Object") by
	  material->setName();
	  (see "PaletteRecords.cpp, line 195) when reading the file, and
	  written
	  to file by
	  dos.writeString( m.Material->getName(), 12 );
	  (see MaterialPaletteManager.cpp, line 80).
	  
	  As these names otherwise get lost when reading an OpenFlight file
	  and
	  writing it again e.g. by
	  osgconv example.flt converted_example.flt
	  these changes make the plugin more complete.
	  
	  The changes were made to OSG revision 8425, and were tested by
	  osgconv example.flt converted_example.flt
	  comparing the material palettes of both files inside Multigen
	  Creator."

2008-06-19 14:29  robert

	* include/osgUtil/SceneView, src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: From
	  Farshid Lashkari, "I noticed some problems when setting up
	  CameraNodes that inherit
	  viewport settings in stereo mode. It seems that the
	  SceneView::cull()
	  method will pass the full size viewport to the left/right
	  cullvisitors, instead of the modified stereo viewport. I made
	  quite a
	  few changes to SceneView to fix the issue. The
	  SceneView::cullStage()
	  method will now receive the viewport as an argument, instead of
	  using
	  the global viewport. The SceneView::cull() method will pass the
	  modifed viewport to cullStage when rendering in stereo.
	  
	  There are 2 new private methods computeLeftEyeViewport() and
	  computeRightEyeViewport() that will compute the stereo viewports.
	  I
	  also modified the draw() function so it applies the correct
	  viewport
	  to the prerender stages. These changes are only necessary for
	  horizontal/vertical split stereo."

2008-06-19 13:49  robert

	* examples/osgviewerWX/osgviewerWX.cpp,
	  examples/osgviewerWX/osgviewerWX.h: From Paul Melis, "Here is a
	  reworked version of the osgviewerWX example. It changes the
	  GraphicsWindowWX to only inherit from osgViewer::GraphicsWindow
	  and adds a standalone widget, called OSGCanvas, that derives from
	  wxGLCanvas. This solves a problem with the GraphicsWindowWX
	  instance being destructed twice (see "Crash in osgviewerWX" of
	  June 12th on osg-users). At program exit, the main frame deletes
	  all of its children widgets and therefore calls
	  GraphicsWindowWX's destructor, bypassing OSG's reference
	  counting. The GraphicsWindowWX instance is then later destructed
	  a second time when the reference held by osg::Camera goes to
	  zero. This bug isn't exposed by the example directly, but if
	  people are going to use the example as a basis (like the poster
	  in the mentioned thread) they very likely will run into this
	  problem.

	  (either _intArray or _floatArray) because none had been allocated

	  rhs's array are valid.
	  
	  I added a call to allocateDataArray() if rhs has (at least) one
	  valid array, which should allocate the right array according to
	  the type. Since the type was copied from rhs, it should create
	  the same array as rhs has, so then it should copy the data in the

	* src/osgUtil/IntersectionVisitor.cpp: From Glenn Waldron, "I'm
	  using an IntersectionVisitor with a PagedLOD database, employing
	  a ReadCallback to allow the intersector to traverse the paged
	  nodes. I discovered that if the visitor is unable (for any
	  reason) to load a subtile via the ReadCallback, the intersection
	  fails. However, I had the requirement to "fall back" on the
	  lower-resolution parent tile and settle for that intersection.
	  
	  This was easy to implement simply by overriding
	  IntersectionVisitor::apply(PagedLOD). My question is: Are there
	  any opinions on whether this should be the default behavior? If

	  "The PNG plugin crashes when you try to read a malformed file
	  (attached
	  is an example). This can happen in circumstances that are not
	  manageable by the OSG itself (e.g. 3rd party buggy program) but
	  one
	  would expect the plugin to be able to recover by returning
	  ReadResult::ERROR_IN_READING_FILE.
	  
	  libpng provides two callbacks for warnings and errors - those are
	  currently unused. By default, they point to function that call
	  exit()
	  or something similar (the default error callback never returns).
	  This
	  patch registers the callbacks using libpng's mechanisms, makes
	  the
	  warning callback emit an osg::notify(osg::WARN) message and the
	  error
	  callback throw an error. The reading process is enclosed in a
	  try...catch block. Upon error, the memory is freed and

	* src/osg/Texture.cpp: From Michael Platings, "Yes it's definitely

	  Platform - various Intel Windows XP SP2 PCs with various nvidia

	  including GeForce 8800 GTS and Quadro FX 4500, and various driver
	  versions including the latest WHQL 175.16.
	  
	  I investigated your concerns about glGenerateMipmapEXT being
	  slower than
	  GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS, and for power-of-two textures, to my
	  surprise
	  it is. For a 512*512 texture, glGenerateMipmapEXT takes on

	  while GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS takes on average 6ms. Therefore I
	  have
	  modified the code to only use glGenerateMipmapEXT if the texture

	  cards mipmap generation for non-power-of-two textures with

	  720*576
	  texture). However, glGenerateMipmapEXT() performs well (16ms for
	  the
	  same texture), so I have modified the attached files to use
	  Texture::generateMipmap() if glGenerateMipmapEXT is supported,
	  instead
	  of enabling & disabling GL_GENERATE_MIPMAP_SGIS."
	  
	  Notes, from Robert Osfield, I've tested the out of the previous

	  7800GT and
	  Nvidia linux drivers with the image size 720x576 and only get

	  src/osgPlugins/txp/TXPNode.h, src/osgPlugins/txp/TXPPagedLOD.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/txp/TXPParser.cpp: From Brad Anderegg, "This
	  submission fixes two bugs and helps some performance problems we
	  have been having with txp databases.
	  
	  
	  
	  The first bug is that the terrain tiles will page out to a lower
	  LOD when they are right in front of you. The issue appears to be
	  with the blacklisting heuristic which forces a tile to LOD 1,
	  commenting out the usage of blacklisting with the LOD Nodes fixes
	  our problem. This code change was made to line 29 of
	  TXPPageLOD.cpp.
	  
	  
	  
	  The second bug we were experiencing is that the database reader
	  options never make it through to the archive loader. The use case
	  for us appeared when the FID codes for the terrain were no longer
	  on the materials. As it turns out the archive was being created
	  twice, once by TXPNode and once by the ReaderWriterTXP on
	  getArchive() so the options never actually got set on the archive
	  that was being loaded. The fix is to first create the archive by
	  calling getArchive on the ReaderWriterTXP, which stores it in a
	  map for reference later, and then passing that archive into the
	  TXPNode for it to set its internal member. With this code change
	  we only create one archive (not sure what creating two did) and
	  our options flags get set properly on the database.
	  
	  
	  
	  The changes made are in TXPNode.h line 72 where the TXPArchive is
	  now passed in. In the TXPNode.cpp the loadArchive(TXPArchive*)
	  was changed to have the default behavior if NULL is passed in, if
	  an archive is passed in then it does not load it since all the
	  loading is done in the ReaderWriterTXP::getArchive(). The only
	  other place that loadArchive is called is in TXPIO.cpp where a
	  modification was made to pass in NULL which will have the same
	  behavior as it used to. The last change is the little block of
	  code starting on line 57 of ReaderWriterTXP.cpp, this was changed
	  so that it first calls getArchive() which caches the archives in
	  a map does some loading stuff and returns a pointer to it which
	  is then passed in as a parameter to TXPNode::loadArchive().
	  
	  
	  
	  The performance changes were made to TXPParser.cpp line 163 where
	  we use to osgUtil::Optimizer on the node before passing it off,
	  and on line 1456 we changed the geometry to use display lists.
	  These small changes actually made drastic performance increases
	  for us, as much as 1000% on certain laptops.
	  
	  
	  
	  As far as testing goes, we have tested these changes with at
	  least 5 txp databases on a variety of different computers
	  including Mac OS and Linux. The base version used is 2.4."

	* CMakeLists.txt: From Cedric Pinson, "By default it's the normal

	  in debug or in release.
	  On windows you have no choice, but on linux you can link with
	  both version without rebuilding everything ...
	  
	  The patch consist only to change the line on one line

	* src/osgUtil/GLObjectsVisitor.cpp: From Stephane Lamoliatte, "Here

	  Finally it seems to not come from the empty geode. The origin of
	  the problem seems to be the uniform initialization during the
	  building of the program which call a glUseProgram.
	  If your scene never display the node that contains the shader and
	  if there is no other shader on the scene, this "glUseProgram" is
	  the only one that is called during your simulation. So, this
	  shader is applied on all the scene.

	  efficient sometimes.
	  
	  Changes includes:
	  1. A new GifImageStream class (inherit from osg::ImageStream and
	  OpenThreads::Thread) have already been added to implement
	  different operations of a GIF movie, such like playing, pausing,
	  rewinding, setting time and so on.
	  2. Some small changes to decode_row() and gif_read_stream(),
	  which make the transparency of GIF images correctly.
	  3. Just a few changes to the ReaderWriterGIF::readGIFStream()
	  function, which ensure that animate GIFs are loaded by
	  GifImageStream (and the function returns GifImageStream objects)
	  and static GIFs unchanged (still use the old method and returns
	  osg::Image objects!).
	  
	  Attachments are the cpp file and an animate GIF file for further

	* examples/osgviewerWX/osgviewerWX.cpp,
	  examples/osgviewerWX/osgviewerWX.h: From Paul Melis, "Here is an
	  update to the osgviewerWX example. Keyboard events were not
	  always received because the GraphicsWindowWX wasn't receiving
	  focus. It now receives focus when the mouse enters the window.
	  * I split the mouse handling from a monolithic method to separate
	  ones, slightly cleaner than a whole bunch of if()'s, especially
	  with another case of the mouse entering the canvas.
	  * I changed the EVT_KEY_DOWN handler to an EVT_CHAR handler,
	  although that now makes the up and down handler assymetric. The
	  new down-handler returns translated key codes, so when you press
	  the S key (without anything else), it actually returns 's' and
	  not 'S' as the EVT_KEY_DOWN did. This means that statistics can
	  be called up in the viewer window, while the example previously
	  only printed a "Stats output:" line to the console. I'm not truly
	  happy that the up handler returns _untranslated_ key codes. But
	  solving this completely would probably mean adding some table
	  that translated from wxWidgets' untranslated key codes to OSG's
	  internal ones. This might be interesting to add, as anyone using
	  OSG + wxWidgets in any serious manner would also have to add
	  this.
	  * I commented out the evt.Skip()'s in the keyboard handlers as
	  these would only be necessary if there were some key events that
	  are not handled. But currently all key events are simply
	  forwarded.
	  * I changed the handling of a mouse drag to a more general mouse
	  move"

	  src/osgWrappers/osgDB/ReaderWriter.cpp: Refactored DatabasePager
	  and related classes to introduce support for
	  multi-threaded paging, where the Pager manages threads of reading
	  local
	  and http files via seperate threads. This makes it possible to
	  smoothly
	  browse large databases where parts of the data are locally cached
	  while
	  others are on a remote server. Previously with this type of
	  dataset
	  the pager would stall all paging while http requests were being
	  served,
	  even when parts of the models are still loadable virtue of being
	  in the
	  local cache.
	  
	  Also as part of the refactoring the DatabaseRequest are now
	  stored in the
	  ProxyNode/PagedLOD nodes to facilitate quite updating in the cull
	  traversal,
	  with the new code avoiding mutex locks and searches. Previous on
	  big
	  databases the overhead involved in make database requests could
	  accumulate
	  to a point where it'd cause the cull traversal to break frame.
	  The overhead
	  now is negligable.
	  
	  Finally OSG_FILE_CACHE support has been moved from the curl
	  plugin into
	  the DatabasePager. Eventually this functionality will be moved
	  out into
	  osgDB for more general usage.

	  the Tab, it's sometimes still in the XKeymapEvent's key_vector,
	  and followed by a Tab KeyRelease event.
	  
	  Avoid this artifact by
	  - asking for a "fresh" keymap (via XQueryKeymap()), rather than
	  using the unreliable(?) XKeymapEvent's key_vector, and by
	  - flushing all key events on focus-in (to avoid the KeyRelease)
	  
	  After Super-press, Tab-press, Super-release, Tab-release (note
	  the wrong release order!) I still get an extra Tab event. But
	  this is not surprising and not exactly wrong either. Also it's
	  hard to avoid, as we can't see what happened to the keyboard

	  To release the memory just if no reading error happened (and

	  Martz, "As I discovered prior to the 2.4 release, the FLT export
	  geometry backend was using some old turn-on code, originally
	  written just to enable other development but not intended for
	  actual release. Sadly, my OSG training commitments prevented me
	  from fixing this prior to 2.4.
	  
	  In essence, the FLT exporter was emitting a full set of Mesh
	  records each time it encountered a PrimitiveSet.
	  
	  Attached is a fix. The code now emits the Mesh set up records,
	  then iterates over all PrimitiveSets and emits a Mesh Primitive
	  record per PrimitiveSet.
	  
	  It also loops over PrimitiveSets twice, first writing Face
	  records according to the mode, the writing Mesh records (again
	  according to the mode).
	  
	  The final change included here is support for GL_POINTS as
	  single-vertex Face records.
	  
	  Billboards are still to come."

	  writing images from/to streams and the code is less cluttered
	  than previous versions.
	  
	  I removed QTtexture.h/.cpp and added QTImportExport.h/.cpp. I
	  updated the CMake-files, I hope they are alright. I used the
	  submitted code in my own apps since two months or so and it seems
	  pretty stable, but as always the migration to the osg-quicktime
	  plugin may have introduced new bugs, so perfect for developer
	  release :)"

	  conversions of the 3 main places i found in osg where tokens are
	  used to represent bitmasks with 'magic' numbers, like 32. i've
	  changed these to a more representative bitshift representation,
	  showing clearly in which bit you can expect this token to
	  manifest. ie, converted things like:
	  
	  from: DEEP_COPY_STATESETS = 8,
	  to: DEEP_COPY_STATESETS = 1<<3,
	  
	  showing clearly that this isn't the _value_ 8, but the _bit_ 8.
	  this is an old pattern i see (and like to promulgate) to make
	  code a bit more readable and maintainable.

	* examples/osgkeyboard/osgkeyboard.cpp,
	  include/osgGA/GUIEventAdapter, src/osgGA/EventQueue.cpp,
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp: From Melchior Franz, "The
	  GUIEventAdapter header file had KeySymbols for the super and
	  hyper keys defined already, but these modifiers were missing in
	  GUIEventAdapter::ModKeyMask, and the EventQueue ingored them as
	  well.
	  
	  The attached diff/archive adds the missing parts for Super/Hyper
	  modifier key support.
	  
	  
	  I'm aware that this might not be supported on all
	  systems/keyboards
	  out of the box, but decided to submit it anyway because:
	  
	  - developers are aware of differences between input devices
	  (Some mice have scroll wheels, others don't. Some have five or
	  more buttons, some have only one. Some keyboards don't have
	  numpads, some have AltGr, some don't etc.)
	  
	  - even if someone relies on Hyper/Super in distributed software,
	  this is easy to fix and doesn't create lock-in conditions
	  
	  - while the names Hyper/Super may only be common on X11, they are
	  just symbol names and not OS-specific
	  
	  - even though some systems might not offer these additional
	  modifiers
	  by default, it's likely that all of them have at least 8 modifier
	  levels internally, so it should only be a matter of OS
	  configuration
	  to make them work
	  
	  - having super/hyper available is useful to offer a user ways
	  to define local key definitions that are safe from collisions
	  with
	  predefined "official" key assignments"

2008-04-11 10:58  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/curl/CMakeLists.txt: From Sherman Wilcox,
	  "Modified the cmakelists.txt file for the curl plugin so the
	  proper
	  linker directories are set in Win32. The old cmakelists.txt would
	  set
	  the lib release folder for debug builds as well. This should
	  correct
	  that."

	* src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp: From Colin McDonald, fixed

	* src/osgDB/DynamicLibrary.cpp, src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp,

2008-04-11 10:16  robert

	* applications/osgconv/osgconv.cpp: From Bob Kuehne, "1) add
	  simplifier command "--simplifier .5" to reduce complexity
	  2) complementarily add a "--overallNormal" to replace
	  per-vert/per-facet normals with an overall. simplifier doesn't
	  work
	  in certain cases without less complex normals. this gets that
	  done.
	  3) add env var output with full verbose output so people realize
	  it's
	  active when the app is run - i see this all the time in training
	  where
	  people run osgconv, with unintended data transformations due to
	  osgUtil:;Optimzer, for example"

	  Introduced code in BoundgingSphere, BoundingBox, ProxyNode and
	  LOD to utilise the above settings.
	  
	  Added Matrix::value_type, Plane::value_type,

	  options that report where the types of floats or doubles.

2008-04-03 18:06  robert

	* src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp: From Colin McDonald, "The
	  X11WindowingSystemInterface in osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp
	  unconditionally sets the X11 error handler routine, replacing
	  anything
	  that was previously set. This is a bit unfriendly, as the X11
	  error
	  handler is a global attribute which the application, or the GUI
	  toolkit
	  being used, may well have set itself.
	  
	  So I have modified X11WindowingSystemInterface to only replace

	* src/osgPlugins/dds/ReaderWriterDDS.cpp: From Mattias Helsing,
	  "While using the dds plugin (via osgdem) it was able to write
	  24bit
	  images with BGR order but not read them. My 2-liner fixed it for
	  me
	  but it may be that someone with more knowledge of the plugin want
	  to
	  insert more pixel formats in the reading part of the plugin."

	  stored in unix style even on Win32"
	  
	  Note from Robert Osfied, simplified this submission so that the
	  added conversion to
	  unix slahes is done on all platforms as this should be safe and
	  simpler to maintain.

2008-03-28 15:52  robert

	* include/osgDB/DatabasePager, src/osgDB/DatabasePager.cpp: Rewrote
	  the DatabasePager::removeExpiredSubgraphs(double) routine as it
	  as not expiring subgraphs quick enough to enable reasonable load
	  balancing.
	  
	  New version isn't perfect and will need further work, but does at
	  least reduce
	  the memory footprint by as much as half on test paths on big
	  databases.
	  
	  The rewritten method no longer uses the the
	  MaximumNumOfRemovedChildPagedLODs
	  and MinimumNumOfInactivePagedLODs variables so these and
	  associated methods
	  for accessing them have been removed.
	  
	  - /** Set the maximum number of PagedLOD child to remove per

	  Changes to existing files:

	  AttrData.cpp/.h -- Minor fixes.
	  CMakeLists.txt -- to include the new files in the build."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, port to non Windows platforms just required
	  fixing of header capitilization errors
	  that windows lets through the net due to having a case
	  insensitive file system.

	* include/osgViewer/api/X11/GraphicsWindowX11,
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp: From Melchoir Franz,
	  "osgViewer toggled the NumLock state correctly when pressing the
	  NumLock
	  key, but it didn't pick up the initial state. So, if NumLock was
	  on for
	  the OS at startup (LED on), it was still off for OSG. And the
	  first
	  keypress turned the LED off, and NumLock on for OSG. The attached
	  fix
	  picks up the state on every FocusIn, just like it was done in the
	  last
	  commits for CapsLock. The difference is, that the NumLock mask
	  isn't
	  standardized (e.g. 0x10 for Linux, and 0x80 for AIX), so we have
	  to do
	  a reverse lookup (::rescanModifierMapping()).
	  
	  Note that I could not reproduce the problem on my system, but
	  someone
	  else confirmed it twice on his, and the patch fixed it for him.

2008-03-13 16:40  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/vrml/ReaderWriterVRML2.cpp: From Gino van den
	  Bergen, "I've added a few fixes to the VRML 2.0 plugin:
	  
	  1) Full DOS paths are now correctly opened by OpenVRML. A URL
	  containing
	  a DOS path should be "file:///C:data/blah" rather than
	  "file://C:data/blah".
	  
	  2) The last primitive defined in "coordIndex" is now added if the
	  "coordIndex" is not terminated by -1.
	  
	  3) Smoothed normals are computed if no normal field is provided.
	  Currently, there is no support for "creaseAngle", so all edges
	  (even the
	  ones sharper than the creaseAngle) are smoothed. I might add this
	  in the
	  future if demand rises.
	  
	  4) If an IndexedFaceSet contains only triangles or quads then the
	  primitive type is set to TRIANGLES or QUADS, and the primset
	  becomes
	  DrawArrays rather than DrawArrayLengths.
	  
	  Question: I noticed that for DrawArrays you can still provide an
	  index
	  array. Would the rendering be faster if I'd create DrawElements
	  primsets
	  rather than DrawArrays? Phrased differently, what is the benefit
	  of
	  using DrawElements over DrawArrays, as there is clearly not a
	  one-to-one
	  mapping of these concepts to their OpenGL counterparts?
	  
	  5) Objects are added to the transparent bin and blend mode is
	  enabled
	  only if the transparency is nonzero. Rendered transparent objects
	  no
	  longer write the depth buffer."

2008-03-13 16:38  robert

	* examples/osgunittests/osgunittests.cpp: From Jose Delport,
	  "attached is a version of osgunittests that does not give false
	  alarms
	  for the case where q1 = -q2. The output of 'osgunittests quat' is
	  now
	  much cleaner.
	  "

2008-03-13 16:22  robert

	* examples/osgviewerWX/osgviewerWX.cpp: From Paul Melis, "Here is
	  an updated osgviewerWX example to bring it more in line with the
	  other GUI toolkit examples. It now takes a model file as
	  command-line
	  argument (complaining if there isn't one), and its startup window
	  size
	  is now actually applied (it used to be too small). I tested this
	  with a
	  unicode-build of wxWidgets, as that is the recommended build type
	  on
	  Linux with GTK. I'm pretty sure this version of the example will
	  work
	  for the ANSI build as well, but I have no way of testing."

2008-03-13 16:18  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/ac/ac3d.cpp: From Melchoir Franz, "ac3d.cpp does
	  currently strip everything but the file name in
	  "texture" paths. This is to drop absolute paths that some
	  3d editors export (even AC3D itself!). But this also strips
	  directories of relative paths, which is wrong and contradicts
	  the ac3d reference implementation. (The reference implementation
	  doesn't strip anything, though, and so takes the absolute paths
	  as they are. Definitely not what we want.)
	  
	  The attached solution checks absolute paths and only strips
	  those:
	  
	  (1) A:\\foo\\bar.png -> bar.png (as before)
	  (2) /foo/bar.png -> bar.png (as before)
	  
	  (3) foo/bar.png -> foo/bar.png (new)
	  (4) ../foo/bar.png -> ../foo/bar.png (new)

	* include/osgGA/StateSetManipulator,

	  change
	  but useful in our context and possibly in others too."

2008-03-04 17:57  robert

	* src/osgViewer/CompositeViewer.cpp: From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "
	  The problem can be reproduced by simply changing the osgpick
	  example to
	  use a CompositeViewer with a single view initialized using
	  setUpViewAcrossAllScreens(). I have attached a modified
	  osgpick.cpp so
	  you can test it out quickly (please don't check this file in
	  though :-)
	  ) The eventState is then incorrect and picking does not work. The
	  only
	  changes are in CompositeViewer.cpp (eventTraversal() method), and
	  fix
	  the problem for me.

2008-03-04 16:39  robert

	* include/osgViewer/api/Win32/PixelBufferWin32,
	  src/osg/GraphicsThread.cpp, src/osgViewer/PixelBufferWin32.cpp:
	  From Colin McDonald, "Attached is an updated to
	  osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32.
	  
	  The win32 pbuffer implementation returned an error unless both
	  the
	  WGL_ARB_pbuffer and the WGL_ARB_render_texture functions were
	  present.
	  This was too restrictive, as a pbuffer can usefully be created
	  without
	  render-to-texture, e.g. for use with glReadPixels. The osg
	  1.2/Producer
	  pbuffers worked without RTT, and osgUtil::RenderStage has all the
	  code to
	  handle both RTT and non-RTT pbuffers, doing a read and copy in
	  the
	  latter case.
	  
	  With these changes I have successfully tested the osgprerender
	  example
	  on a graphics card which supports RTT, and one which doesn't.
	  Plus
	  tested in my own application.
	  
	  In order to aid diagnostics I have also added more function
	  status
	  return checks, and associated error messages. I have included the
	  win32
	  error text in all error messages output. And there were some
	  errors
	  with multi-threaded handling of "bind to texture" and a temporary
	  window
	  context which I have corrected.
	  
	  These is one (pre-existing) problem with multi-threaded use of
	  pbuffers
	  in osgViewer & osgprerender, which I have not been able to fix. A
	  win32
	  device context (HDC) can only be destroyed from the thread that
	  created
	  it. The pbuffers for pre-render cameras are created in
	  osgUtil::RenderStage::runCameraSetUp, from the draw thread. But
	  closeImplementation is normally invoked from the destructor in
	  the main
	  application thread. With the additional error messages I have
	  added,
	  osgprerender will now output a couple of warnings from
	  osgViewer::PixelBufferWin32::closeImplementation() at exit, after
	  running multi-threaded on windows. I think that is a good thing,
	  to
	  highlight the problem. I looked into fixing it in
	  osgViewer::Renderer &
	  osgUtil::RenderStage, but it was too involved for me. My own
	  application requirements are only single-threaded.
	  
	  Unrelated fix - an uninitialised variable in
	  osg::GraphicsThread::FlushDeletedGLObjectsOperation().
	  "

2008-03-04 16:22  robert

	* src/osgShadow/ShadowMap.cpp: From Wojciech Lewandowski, "Attached
	  is modified osgShadow::ShadowMap. I changed following things:
	  
	  1:
	  Shadow map camera sets ABSOLUTE_RF_INHERIT_VIEWPOINT refernce
	  frame.
	  
	  2:
	  Light Direction by matrix multiplications replaced with
	  transform3x3 multiplication.
	  
	  3:
	  I made DebugingHUD functional by adding special draw callback.
	  Former version was simply drawing pale square.
	  
	  4:
	  I was tempted to make 4 th change but decided to not do it.
	  Instead I put it whith #if VIEW_DEPNDENT_TEXGEN. If you decide
	  you may let it go.
	  
	  When objects are not centered at 0,0,0 coord but in some distant
	  location (for example at surface of earth ellipsoid) shadow
	  texgen suffers from inadequate precision of float matrices. I
	  changed that by premultiplying Texgen matrix (using OSG double
	  matrices) with inverse modelview and applying it later with
	  ModelView identity matrix. This tweak may be appropriate for
	  OverlayNode texgen as well.
	  
	  I left former version because I suspect that this change will
	  make osgShadow::ShadowMap view dependant. Currently texgen matrix
	  remains the same no matter what View displays it. With my change
	  it wuld be different for each view. This touches the subject of
	  View Dependent Shadow Techniques that J-S asked recently."

	* src/osg/FrameBufferObject.cpp: From Art Trevs, "in the current

	  like this:
	  
	  FrameBufferAttachment(Texture3D* target, int zoffset,
	  int level = 0);
	  
	  However in the .cpp file we have:
	  
	  FrameBufferAttachment::FrameBufferAttachment(Texture3D*
	  target, int level, int zoffset)
	  
	  
	  Which means that the meaning of level and zoffset is
	  interchanged.

2008-02-25 16:50  robert

	* include/osgViewer/api/X11/GraphicsWindowX11,
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp: From Franz Melchior, "When
	  switching virtual desktops or minimizing a window, keys
	  remain in pressed state after revealing, even if they are no
	  longer pressed on the keyboard. This can have bad effects,
	  especially if the stuck keys are modifier keys. One has to
	  press and release the stuck keys again to reset the wrong state.
	  
	  The fix keeps track of all key presses and releases. On FocusOut
	  and UnmapNotify it releases all keys that are in pressed state,
	  and on KeymapNotify (following a FocusIn), it sets the currently
	  pressed keys again. To avoid confusion in the OSG-using
	  application
	  normal keys are always reported released /before/ and pressed
	  /after/ modifier keys.
	  
	  As current key states are returned as char[32] keymap by
	  XQueryKeymap and XKeymapEvent, this format is also used to
	  recognize modifier keys and for maintaining the current
	  internal key state. Functions to set/clear/query bits in
	  such a keymap are added.
	  
	  The patch was extensively tested with osgkeyboard and
	  FlightGear under KDE and fvwm2. It was not tested on a
	  Xinerama setup or with multiple windows, but as _eventDisplay
	  is used throughout, there should be no problems. The patch also
	  makes the following changes:
	  
	  - removes old and obsolete handling of modifier keys in
	  ::adaptKey().
	  This wasn't only unused, but also wrong (and for that reason
	  commented
	  out in revision 7066). The modifier states are actually handled
	  in ./src/osgGA/EventQueue.cpp (EventQueue::keyPress/keyRelease).
	  - fixes some spelling"

	  The modifications I made are very small but they are absolutely
	  usefull to use osgIntrospection with visual studio 7.1 or 8 in
	  debug modes.
	  This should also solve other minor common problems (converter
	  memory leak, virtual destructor for PropertyInfo, etc...).
	  
	  I choosed two function names : Reflection::uninitialize() and
	  Type::reset(), this can of course be changed if someone has a
	  better idea...
	  
	  I made the changes against OSG 2.2.0 public release. I tested the
	  result with VS 7.1, VS 7.1 SP1, VS 8.0 SP1 and AQTime 5.0 on
	  Windows XP SP2... All 4 seem to agree : they detected memory
	  leaks before and don't anymore.
	  
	  Sorry I haven't take the time to test that on linux but the
	  changes are so small I doubt there could be a problem... I let
	  you check that on your side :-).

	* include/osg/Plane, src/osgSim/OverlayNode.cpp: From Wojciech
	  Lewandowski, "----1----
	  
	  Attached is a fixed version of OverlayNode.cpp. I fixed
	  CustomPolytope::cut( osg::Plane ) method. Bug was apparent in
	  such scenario:
	  
	  Let P1 be some random frustum polytope
	  Let P2 be the polytope that was created from P1 bounding box (P2
	  contains P1 entirely)
	  
	  Then ignoring precision errors: P1.cut( P2 ) == P2.cut( P1 ) ==
	  P1. But this condition was not always met. Cut failed when some
	  of the polytope reference points happened to lie exactly on some
	  intersecting planes in both P1 & P2 (plane distance was = 0).
	  
	  I only use CustomPolytope for my shadowing stuff so I did not
	  test how this affects rest of OverlayNode.cpp.
	  
	  ----2----
	  
	  Also attached is a minor precision improvement for osg::Plane
	  intersect method (double version).
	  
	  ----3----
	  
	  I have also one observation regarding osg::Plane - There are two
	  intersect vertices methods (float and double flavour):
	  
	  inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3>& vertices) const
	  inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3d>& vertices) const
	  
	  I guess osg::Plane won't compile when someone changes default
	  vec3 typedef to vec3d. Shouldn't the first method be changed to
	  use vec3f explicitly ? Ie:
	  
	  inline int intersect(const std::vector<Vec3f>& vertices) const"

	  This is caused by the OSG_MSVC_VERSIONED_DLL hack.
	  there are hard-coded paths to place the dll's in the bin /dir
	  that normally would go
	  in the lib/config (release/debug) dirs. Nmake has different
	  locations for the files (no config dir).
	  
	  fix: change the macro's in OsgMacroUtils.cmake for the IF(NOT
	  MSVC_IDE) situation.
	  Libs go in lib/, and DLLs and executables go in bin/
	  To accopmplish this for MSVC_IDE the targets get a "../../bin"
	  prefix,
	  for nmake this should be "../bin" (because there are no config
	  folders).
	  
	  This fix mimics the behaviour of the MSCV_IDE (visual studio)
	  build system when building with nmake.
	  
	  Note:
	  A change in the main CMakeLists.txt creates the needed plugin
	  directory in the binary dir.

	  It contained a bug that would cause freed memory to be written
	  again.
	  Specifically, in FreeTypeLibrary::~FreeTypeLibrary(), calling
	  font->setImplementation(0); deletes the content pointed to by the
	  fontImplementation pointer, while the line the immediately
	  follows
	  tries to access it.
	  
	  My fix is to make the second instruction part of an else clause
	  rather
	  than always executed. This way, the fontImplementation->_facade =
	  0
	  instruction is only executed when the font implementation is not
	  set
	  to 0 before (although I have no idea what it is here for and if

	* CMakeModules/FindFreeType.cmake, CMakeModules/FindGDAL.cmake,
	  CMakeModules/FindGIFLIB.cmake,
	  CMakeModules/FindOpenThreads.cmake,
	  CMakeModules/FindQuickTime.cmake: From Eric Wing, "Attached are a
	  few Find modules with updates. Among other things, they
	  contain better support for environmental variables to pre-empt
	  the
	  autodection default search path order which is very helpful for
	  people
	  who do automated builds. (I recommend that the remaining modules
	  consider adding the same system to make things consistent and
	  easier
	  for those people that want to do the automated builds.)
	  
	  The CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH has also been added to help people. I don't
	  recommend adding this to the other modules because it looks like
	  CMake
	  agreed with my idea and will be adding the support in 2.6. So
	  when
	  that ships, people will get it for free. (In the meantime, my
	  modules
	  that do have it, it can be used.)
	  
	  Finally, I've submitted all of these modules to official CMake
	  plus
	  more so they will be in the next version of CMake. It looks like
	  I may
	  need to sort some compatibility issues out with the KDE people
	  who
	  seem to have conflicting modules, but this is unrelated to the
	  updates
	  submitted here as OSG already has these conflicts. I figured I
	  would
	  just sync OSG up with my current/best versions.
	  
	  Also of note, I added the large batch of Findosg*.cmake modules
	  to
	  CMake so people building against OpenSceneGraph can use these
	  without
	  writing their own. I wasn't sure if I should submit them here or
	  not
	  since they are for building against OSG and not for building OSG
	  itself. So they are not included.

	* src/osg/Sequence.cpp: From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "When using
	  osg::Sequence you can stop the sequence by setting the mode
	  to STOP. Subsequently, you can restart it from the beginning by
	  setting the mode to START. This does not work as expected. The
	  _now
	  time is not updated while the mode is STOP, which causes the
	  items in
	  the sequence to flash by very quickly when the mode is set to
	  START.
	  
	  For example, if the mode was set to STOP and left that way for 30
	  seconds, and there are 10 items in the sequence, when the mode is
	  set
	  to START all the items will flash by (in 3 loops) while the _now
	  time
	  catches up with the real time, and then the sequence will go on
	  at the
	  rate it should.
	  
	  This is a simple fix for that, which updates the _now time
	  regardless
	  of the mode the sequence is in."

	  What stroke me in this email was the fact that there was once an
	  error in
	  Polytope class. Since I adopted CustomPolytope (osgSim
	  OverlayNode.cpp) for
	  my minimal shadow area computations I checked my code for this
	  error. And I
	  found it in CustomPolytope::setToUnitFrustum method.
	  CustomPolytope::setToBoundingBox seemed OK.
	  
	  So I went back to the origin and fixed this error in
	  OverlayNode.cpp as
	  well. I have not tested it in OverlayNode though (I don't know
	  how) so

2007-12-17 09:58  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/osga/OSGA_Archive.cpp: From Wojiech Leandowski, "I
	  earlier wrote about my hassles with archives under Windows. I
	  implemented
	  64 bit binary compatible OSGA archive reader/writer using mixed
	  stdio/iostream calls. But during this work I learned that it can
	  be made in
	  much simpler way.
	  
	  Attached is result of this new attempt. I hope its appropriate
	  for inclusion
	  into OSG codebase. It was compiled and tested with latest SVN
	  OSG, Windows
	  XP 32 bit and Windows Vista business 64 bit. OSG was built using
	  VS 2005
	  Express SP1 for 32 bit environment and VS 2005 Std for 64 bit.
	  ---
	  Solution description (there were two problems involved):
	  ---
	  Problem 1: implicit conversions beetween file positions and 32
	  bit int. This
	  could be considered a MS compiler bug because this 32 bit int was
	  additionally implicitly converted to/from 64 bit. As far as I
	  know compiler
	  is allowed to make only one implict conversion (but maybe this
	  rule does not
	  refer to simple types).
	  
	  Its actually possible to address OSGA files above 4 GiB range
	  using 32 bit
	  windows iostreams. MS Iostreams in practice offer the same level
	  of
	  functionality as stdio functions. There are functions fsetpos and
	  fgetpos in
	  stdio lib which use 64 bit file pointers (fpos_t). These
	  functions are
	  internally called by seekp( streampos ), seekg( streampos ),
	  tellp(), and
	  tellg() methods. So its also possible to change and retrieve file
	  postions
	  using iostream calls. But the problem lies in implicit handling
	  of streampos
	  type.
	  
	  streampos type is actually a template class used as seekp, seekg
	  parameter
	  and returnd from tellp, tellg. Its capable of storing 64 bit file
	  pointers.
	  But streampos can be also converted to/from simple type
	  streamoff. It has
	  proper constructor and cast operator. In Win 32 environment
	  streamoff is
	  defined as long (~32 bit int). So when seekp, and tellp arent
	  used with
	  exact streampos objects but OSGA_Archive::pos_type complier makes
	  implicit
	  casts to 32 bit int types loosing important bits of information.
	  
	  So above problem could be easily handled by making conversion
	  calls
	  explicit. My code defines 2 functions used to convert back and
	  forth beetwen
	  64 bit OSGA_Archive::pos_type and std::streampos objects:
	  
	  OSGA_Archive::pos_type ARCHIVE_POS( const std::streampos & pos );
	  std::streampos STREAM_POS( OSGA_Archive::pos_type & pos );
	  
	  Rest of the OSGA implementation code was modified to call these
	  conversions
	  explicitly with seekp, seekg, tellp, tellg.
	  
	  ---
	  Problem 2: seekp and seekg have two variants. Only one of these
	  variants is
	  actually 64 bit proof.
	  
	  When I solved my first problem and made use of explicit streampos
	  conversion
	  functions, OSGA archive was able to read my example 11 GiB
	  archive. But
	  there were still problems with write and append. I found that the
	  reason for
	  this was pair of seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end ) and tellp()
	  calls. It turned
	  out that use of seekp, seekg( offset, direction ) function
	  variants was
	  setting file pos pointer to EOF when file was larger than 4GiB.
	  But I
	  noticed that one arg seekp, seekg ( streampos ) versions worked
	  correctly.
	  So the solution was to change OSGA write logic a little, and
	  replace
	  seekp( offset, direction ) with seekp( absolute_pos ) calls.
	  I achieved this by modifing IndexBlock write method to record and
	  restore
	  file pos after IndexBlock was written. This modification has the
	  effect that
	  put pointer is generally kept at the end of file, so there is no
	  need to
	  repostion to the end before writing the files. This allowed me to
	  get rid of
	  those problematic seekp( 0, std::ios_base::end ) calls.
	  
	  There was one place where I could not easily get rid of seekp( 0,
	  std::ios_base::end ). It was situation where existing OSGA was
	  opened for
	  appending. I resolved this by computing file length by finding
	  max position
	  from index block and file block endings. Then I replaced former
	  seekp( 0,
	  std::ios_base::end ) with seekp( STREAM_POS( found_file_length ).
	  ---
	  
	  Description of these changes may sound bit hacky but in practice
	  these were
	  fairly simple and straightforward modifications. I hope they pass
	  your
	  review. There is one complex preprocessor condition which I based
	  on few
	  lines taken from boost positioning.hpp. Boost licence does allow
	  such
	  reproduction. In case of problems this condition may be easily
	  simplified to
	  windows only implementation.

	* src/osg/ShapeDrawable.cpp: From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Some
	  clients at my new job noticed that picking did not work with the
	  osg::Capsule subclass of osg::Shape in an osg::ShapeDrawable.
	  Other
	  shapes worked fine. So I have fixed this. Code attached.
	  
	  My modification is in the PrimitiveShapeVisitor, and is based on
	  the
	  DrawShapeVisitor - I added methods called createCylinderBody and
	  createHalfSphere, and used them in apply(Cylinder&) and
	  apply(Capsule&). In my testing they work fine, tested even with
	  transforms and moving around the scene.

	  From Roger James, "The changes are as follows:-
	  
	  1. DAE object no longer held onto by plugin.
	  2. Filename to URI conversion now handled internally by plugin.
	  2. User can supply an external DAE object for use by the plugin.
	  3. User can supply a std:string object for the plugin to return
	  the URI of
	  the document just processed.
	  4. User can supply a std::string to receive the unit name
	  information from
	  the document just read in. (e.g. meters, inches, etc.)
	  5. User can supply a float to receive the metric conversion
	  factor from the
	  document just read in.
	  6. User can supply an enum to receive the up axis orientation
	  information
	  from the document just read in.
	  7. Material transparency can be both read and written.
	  8. User can supply an experimental GoogleMode option on output.
	  The plugin
	  will try to emulate the way Sketchup specifies transparency (i.e.
	  the
	  inverse of what it should be!). I am still struggling to get GE
	  to
	  understand transparency, anyone know what it expects?
	  9. Rudimentary support for Collada effect parameters (newparam,
	  setparam,
	  param) on input. Basic nVidia FX Composer dae documents can now
	  be read.

	  From Tim More, "This submission tries to optimize redundant
	  compilation of StateSets and Drawables
	  in the DatabasePager. The practical effects of these are to
	  greatly reduce startup time
	  and the time to load an individual scenery tile in FlightGear.
	  
	  - From my log message:
	  
	  Minimize the number of StateSets and drawables that are compiled
	  by checking
	  if they have already been compiled or will be elminated by the
	  SharedStateManager.
	  
	  Move the sorting of the dataToCompile queue out of
	  compileGLObjects
	  into the man pager run function.
	  
	  Change the SharedStateManager to use maps instead of vectors."

2007-12-11 11:55  robert

	* src/osg/ClipNode.cpp: From Mathias Froelich, "I have cleaned up
	  the state set handling of the osg::ClipNode.
	  Previously the complete StateSet was cleared, even the non
	  clipping releted
	  state attributes and modes in this stateset on a call to
	  setLocalSetateSetModes.
	  With this change only those modes/attributes are changed that
	  need to be
	  changed. That is, if a clip plane is removed from the ClipNode,
	  only this
	  assiciated mode is removed from the state set, instead of
	  throwing away the
	  whole state set.
	  
	  In this way we have less surprising results if the state set of a
	  clip node is
	  used for more state than just the clip state.
	  "

	  lighting
	  -- illum==1 -> osg::Material specular is set to black

	  http://www.openscenegraph.org/svn/osg/OpenSceneGraph/tags/OpenSceneGraph-2.2.0
	  
	  The changes where needed for being able to read VRML file which
	  are
	  output by VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). A sample
	  VRML file
	  is enclosed in this submission.
	  
	  The plugin has been tested against a number of VRML samples that
	  include
	  texturing. The texturing is found to be VRML97 compliant for all
	  added
	  geometry nodes.

2007-12-09 16:06  robert

	* src/osgShadow/ShadowMap.cpp: From Mihai Radu, "After someone
	  asked for a fix for non-textured object appearing black
	  with the shader for textured objects. This works very well in
	  cases
	  where there could be a mix of textured and non-textured objects
	  in the
	  scene, and it makes the initialization more robust.
	  The idea is from PSSM, to add a 1pixel texture to the main
	  rendering as
	  to provide white for any objects missing textures."

2007-12-08 17:10  robert

	* src/osg/StateSet.cpp: From Mario Guimaraes, "Currently, in the
	  StateSet::merge method, the rhs state attributes and
	  modes are not merged into the lhs state when the rhs is
	  PROTECTED. The
	  changes I'm providing here address this problem."

2007-12-08 17:04  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/CMakeLists.txt, src/osgWrappers/CMakeLists.txt:
	  From Serge Lages, "Hi Robert,
	  
	  You were right about the CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS option for
	  CMake, so here is a modification allowing to not generate the
	  manifest files for the plugins making them a lot more easy to
	  redistribute. I have also made the same modification to the
	  wrappers as they are also put into the osgPlugin folder when
	  generated.
	  "

2007-12-08 17:00  robert

	* src/osg/Geometry.cpp: from Paul Matz, "Understood. Well, I think
	  it's reasonable to assume that the non-env var
	  case is the more tested case, and therefore it is correct to set
	  _supportsVertexBufferObjects to the same value as _fastPath. So
	  here's a
	  change that does the same thing for the env var case."

2007-12-08 16:52  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/dae/CMakeLists.txt: From Jeremy Moles, Anders
	  Backman and Robert Osfield,
	  
	  both Jeremy and Anders added static build support as an option,
	  but one was
	  for Unix and one for Windowsm, but the two mods were also
	  inconsitent in naming
	  and implementation. I have had a bash at merging them both, but
	  don't know yet
	  if these changes will work yet on either configuration... user
	  testing will tell...

2007-12-08 16:37  robert

	* examples/osgkeyboardmouse/osgkeyboardmouse.cpp,
	  include/osgUtil/PolytopeIntersector,
	  src/osgUtil/PolytopeIntersector.cpp: From Peter Hrenka, "Due to
	  popular demand I would like to submit this
	  enhanced version of PolytopeIntersector.
	  
	  
	  New features of PolytopeIntersector :
	  
	  * Dimension mask: The user may specify the dimensions of the
	  primitives to be tested. Checking polytope-triangle and
	  polytope-quad intersections is rather slow so this can
	  be turned off.
	  * Reference plane: The resulting intersections are sorted
	  by the distance to this plane.
	  
	  New memebers of PolytopeIntersector::Intersection :
	  
	  * distance: Distance of localIntersectionPoint to the reference
	  plane
	  * maxDistance: Maximum distance of all intersectionPoints to the
	  reference plane.
	  * intersectionPoints: The points intersecting the planes of the
	  polytope
	  or points completely inside the polytope.
	  * localIntersectionPoint: arithmetic mean of all intersection
	  points
	  * primitiveIndex: Index of the primitive that intersected
	  
	  
	  I added some more output to the example osgkeyboardmouse."

	  Osfield, David addded a new style of OSG integration with QT by
	  sublcassing from QTWidget and using osgViewer to create the
	  graphics context, Robert added integration of this codes
	  with the original AdapterWidget implementation still available by
	  default. The new implementation can be accessed by running:
	  
	  osgviewerQT cow.osg --QOSGWidget
	  

2007-12-08 15:32  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/quicktime/QTUtils.h: From Daniel Larimer, "There

	* src/osgPlugins/3ds/ReaderWriter3DS.cpp: From Neil Hughes, "Please
	  find attached a replacement for the 3DS pluggin's
	  ReaderWriter3DS.cpp file. This contains a minor fix (one line
	  added) to ensure that the OSG Material structure is given the
	  name of the material definition within a loaded 3DS file.
	  "

2007-12-08 15:08  robert

	* src/osgViewer/View.cpp: From Donald Cipperly, Fixed memory leak
	  in computeIntersections

2007-12-08 15:04  robert

	* examples/osgviewerSDL/osgviewerSDL.cpp: From Jeremy Moles, "This
	  extra call to SDL_VideoSetMode() prevents my viewport from
	  getting
	  all wonky when I resize the SDL window. I'm not sure if this bug
	  has
	  always existed or not, but according to the SDL documentation
	  this
	  operation should be safe regardless, and doesn't not introduce
	  the need
	  for extra memory management (that is: there is no need to
	  "cleanup" the
	  old screen variable, that is all handled by SDL for us).
	  "

	* include/osg/ClipPlane, include/osg/Hint, include/osg/Light,
	  src/osg/ClipPlane.cpp, src/osg/Hint.cpp, src/osg/Light.cpp: From
	  Robert Osfield and Richard Schmidt, made fixes inspired by an
	  original submission from Richard which
	  highlighted problems with Light, ClipPlane and Hint usage in
	  osg::State's usage of cloneType
	  and reassignment of target/num in StateSet/these StateAttributes.

2007-12-08 12:12  robert

	  #include<assert.h> to avoid compile problems on some systems.

2007-12-07 13:28  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/RoadRecords.cpp: From Tony Horrobin,
	  "Attached is a small fix for the openflight loader with regard to
	  road
	  segment and construction records.
	  
	  It just uses the id field to set the name of the osg node as with
	  other
	  types."

2007-12-07 13:19  robert

	* src/osgDB/DatabasePager.cpp: From Paul Martz, minor typo fixes in

	  event handlers

2007-12-06 17:44  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/bmp/ReaderWriterBMP.cpp: From Farshid Lashkari,
	  "The bmp writer crashes in certain cases. It happens when the
	  computed
	  size of the image data is greater than the actual image size.
	  This
	  causes the memcpy call to go out of the array bounds. I modified
	  the
	  code so that it copies the data during the iteration, instead of
	  memcpy'ing. This fixes the problems i was having.
	  
	  If you are curious, the writer was crashing when trying to write
	  an
	  RGB image that was 2050 x 1280. You might be able to reproduce it
	  by
	  allocating an empty image of that size and writing it to a file."

2007-12-06 17:41  robert

	* src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp: From Hautio Jari, "Current
	  version of GraphicsWindowWin32 allows resize to zero height
	  window. This breaks rendering in for example MFC SDI applications
	  and in
	  MFC MDI applications if user resizes the window so that client
	  area has
	  zero height. Current safeguard for minimized window:
	  
	  LRESULT GraphicsWindowWin32::handleNativeWindowingEvent( HWND
	  hwnd, UINT
	  uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam )
	  ...
	  /////////////////
	  case WM_MOVE :
	  case WM_SIZE :
	  /////////////////
	  ...
	  if (clientRect.bottom==0 && clientRect.right==0)
	  ...
	  
	  does not cover this situation. In these situations
	  clientRect.bottom = 0
	  and clientRect.right > 0.
	  
	  Quick fix to this is relax condition:
	  if (clientRect.bottom==0 || clientRect.right==0)
	  
	  Modified file is attached.
	  
	  Tested with osgviewerMFC from 2.2.0 release (Windows XP sp2)
	  
	  Before fix:
	  - execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe cow.osg.
	  - the cow is rendered nicely.
	  - resize window to zero height by dragging from bottom border
	  upwards.
	  - resize window back to original height
	  - just blue screen, no cow
	  
	  After fix:
	  - execute from command line osgviewerMFC.exe cow.osg.
	  - the cow is rendered nicely.
	  - resize window to zero height by dragging from bottom border
	  upwards.
	  - resize window back to original height
	  - the cow is where it is supposed to be.
	  "

2007-12-06 17:31  robert

	* include/osgDB/DatabasePager, src/osgDB/DatabasePager.cpp: From
	  Serge Lages, "Here are some modifications to the DatabasePager,
	  with the possibility to :
	  
	  - Get or set the target number of PagedLOD children to remove per
	  frame.
	  - Get or set the minimum number of inactive PagedLOD to keep.
	  
	  Corresponding environment variables have been added too.
	  The default values reproduce the previous DatabasePager
	  behavior."

	* examples/osgunittests/osgunittests.cpp: From Mathias Froehlich,
	  "Attached is a changed version of osgunittests.cpp. The
	  __FUNCTION__
	  macro/string value is not portable. Instead the functions name is
	  just put
	  into the string."

	* Xcode/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
	  For osgdb_freetype:
	  Ugh. Another fix for the cycle problem. It seems that the SDKROOT
	  didn't necessarily solve the problem, but there were some
	  unneeded library dependencies that weren't in my test fork which
	  allowed my test to work, but caused SVN to fail.
	  I have removed some of the excess libraries and it seems to build
	  without the Q&A fix.

2007-11-09 13:16  ewing

	* CMakeLists.txt: Added support for defining an option
	  OSG_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT within the
	  CMake build system, enabling this option will build the OSG
	  against the (...) version
	  of the tesselation callback functions.
	  
	  One can also set the default value of this option via the
	  DEFAULT_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT
	  variable that is set locally to OFF for all platforms except AIX
	  and OSX, but can
	  be overriden by setting it via command line option i.e.
	  
	  cmake . -DDDEFAULT_GLU_TESS_CALLBACK_TRIPLEDOT=ON

2007-10-02 21:45  robert

	* src/osgWrappers/osgShadow/ShadowMap.cpp: Updated wrappers

2007-10-02 21:45  robert

	* examples/osgshadow/osgshadow.cpp, include/osgShadow/ShadowMap,
	  src/osgShadow/ShadowMap.cpp: From Mihair Radu, "Most of the
	  additions are small utility methods:
	  - set the resolution of the shadow map; it calls dirty() to
	  re-initialize at next update
	  - keep a list of Shader objects to use instead of the default
	  ones, if
	  the list is empty, the default shaders are used
	  - explicitly create the Uniform variables, so that subsequent
	  additions
	  that require more Uniforms can put them in a central place
	  - set a Light or LightSource to use explicitly for shadow
	  casting,
	  allows multiple lights in the scene, with one casting shadows
	  
	  There are two additions that do not ( yet ) function correctly,
	  but in
	  the present usage they do not interfere with the regular usage of
	  the
	  techique:
	  - support for using spotlights, it's using Light.spotCutoff to
	  determine
	  if it's a spot-light and not point-light,
	  there is an error in the setup of either the shadow camera or the
	  texgen, most likely due to the direction of the spotlight, since
	  the
	  position is being used just like in point or directional lights.
	  - creation of a debugHUD
	  the hud is created properly, ( the example included shows it ),
	  but
	  it displays only white, there has been some discussion of
	  displaying the
	  shadow map, but I could not find it, the addition of a simple
	  fragment
	  shader with the appropriate color transform should get this
	  going."

	  variable into CMake build system with it set to

	  Mingw where
	  it is set to "mingw_". Updated osgDB::Registry to look for these

	  previously just supported by osgViewer::Viewer

2007-10-02 20:56  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt: Changed the search for Qt version to prevent

	* src/osgPlugins/hdr/ReaderWriterHDR.cpp,

	  From David Spilling, "Please find attached an extension of the

	  The options are intended to match the existing read options. By
	  default it will only write RGB32F format; if the "RAW" option is
	  selected, it will output 8 bit RGBA as "raw" RGBE. Note also that
	  the writer inserts a flipVertical(); although the RGBE format,
	  according to spec, should support top-to-bottom or bottom-to-top
	  ordering, no software I've found, including that from the formats
	  originator, actually respects this."

2007-09-30 15:06  robert

	* include/osgText/Text, src/osgText/Text.cpp: From Dan Minor,
	  "osgText::Text does not currently have a getAxisAlignment method.
	  The
	  attached code adds this, along with a member variable to keep
	  track of
	  the setting. It is based on the latest subversion version, and
	  was
	  tested by creating a new text object with the same axis alignment
	  as an
	  existing one (e.g.
	  new_text->setAxisAlignment(old_text->getAxisAlignment()); )."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, " I originally didn't add a
	  getAxisAlignment()
	  as all setAxisAlignment does is set the Rotation member variable,
	  and
	  potentially one could apply user defined Rotation setting after
	  the
	  setAxisAlignment() which would bring it out of sync with the
	  setAxisAlignment.
	  
	  Rather than reject your submission on the ground of potentially
	  getting out of sync and therefore misleading users I've added a
	  USED_DEFINED_ROTATION to AxisAlignment enum, and set this in the
	  serRotation and then override this setting of _axisAlignment in
	  the
	  setAxisAlingment method. I've also removed the lazy updating
	  optimization you've added to the top of setAxisAlignment to avoid
	  potential problems as well."

	  move\u201d discussion thread on Sept. 20). The issue was that the
	  initial implementation added a few months back was not converting

	  - Implementation of integer textures as in EXT_texture_integer
	  
	  - setBorderColor(Vec4) changed to setBorderColor(Vec4d) to pass
	  double values
	  as border color. (Probably we have to provide an overloading
	  function to
	  still support Vec4f ?)
	  
	  - new method Texture::getInternalFormatType() added. Gives
	  information if the
	  internal format normalized, float, signed integer or unsigned
	  integer. Can
	  help people to write better code ;-)

	  "A new texture class Texture2DArray derived from
	  Texture extends the osg to support the new
	  EXT_texture_array extensions. Texture arrays provides
	  a feature for people interesting in GPGPU programming.
	  
	  
	  Faetures and changes:
	  
	  - Full support for layered 2D textures.
	  
	  - New uniform types were added (sampler2DArray)
	  
	  - FrameBufferObject implementation were changed to
	  support attaching of 2D array textures to the
	  framebuffer
	  
	  - StateSet was slightly changed to support texture
	  arrays. NOTE: array textures can not be used in fixed
	  function pipeline. Thus using the layered texture as a
	  statemode for a Drawable produce invalid enumerant
	  OpenGL errors.
	  
	  - Image class was extended to support handling of
	  array textures
	  
	  Tests:
	  I have used this class as a new feature of my
	  application. It works for me without problems (Note:
	  Texture arrays were introduced only for shading
	  languages and not for fixed function pipelines!!!).
	  RTT with Texture2DArray works, as I have tested them
	  as texture targets for a camera with 6 layers/faces
	  (i.e. replacement for cube maps). I am using the array
	  textures in shader programming. Array textures can be
	  attached to the FBO and used as input and as output."

	  src/osgWrappers/osg/DisplaySettings.cpp: From Galen Faidley,"
	  Please find attached the modifications to get the new
	  checkerboard
	  stereo format to work. It's a good thing I tested these on a TV
	  before submitting them since I did indeed have a bug. One thing I
	  did not test was to see how this would work in windowed mode.
	  Does
	  the interlaced stereo code have support for 'absolute' positions?
	  For example a given pixel on the screen is always shown in a
	  given
	  eye no matter where the graphics context is placed?
	  "

2007-08-23 14:10  robert

	* src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp: From Jean-Sebastien Guay,"As discussed
	  yesterday on the osg-users list, I have altered
	  src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp to implement the official Windows DLL
	  search
	  order as described on the page
	  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586.aspx . As
	  mentioned,
	  the search order is now:
	  1. The directory from which the application loaded.
	  2. The system directory. (C:\Windows\System32 by default, gotten
	  using the
	  GetSystemDirectory function)
	  3. The 16-bit system directory. (C:\Windows\System by default,
	  gotten by
	  adding "\System" to the path gotten in the next step...)
	  4. The Windows directory. (C:\Windows by default, gotten using
	  the
	  GetWindowsDirectory function)
	  5. The current directory. (".")
	  6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment
	  variable. (as
	  before)
	  
	  The first four directories are obtained using Win32 API calls, so
	  they
	  should work correctly even on non-standard Windows installs.
	  
	  The changes are well commented and should be clear, even to
	  someone
	  not familiar with the Win32 API.
	  
	  I have tested in a few scenarios and it works as expected. Serge
	  Lages
	  has also tested the changes and confirmed they worked as
	  described. I
	  have not had any other reports though (positive or negative).
	  
	  I also fixed the issue with a trailing semicolon on the PATH
	  adding an
	  empty string to the end of the search paths, as this was an
	  inconsistent side effect rather than a desirable effect. This
	  change
	  will take effect on other platforms as well, but since it tests
	  for an
	  empty string in the last item added to the search paths, it
	  should
	  have no adverse effect.

	* src/osgPlugins/vrml/ReaderWriterVRML2.cpp: From Jean-Sebastien

	  the init method of the
	  geometrytechnique in submethods to made more easy the inheritance
	  between the user and osg-class. This is a first step to add more
	  functions in osgTerrain. Maybe the subdivision of the method have
	  to
	  be in the terraintechnique because is the base class of
	  GeometryTechnique. If Robert or anyone think that this is better
	  i
	  change this class too."

2007-08-15 15:11  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/vrml/ReaderWriterVRML2.cpp: From Jan Ciger, "I am
	  attaching a little hack from Jean-Sebastien Guay which allows
	  absolute paths to work on Windows."

2007-08-15 15:07  robert

	* src/osgShadow/SoftShadowMap.cpp: From Stephan Huber, "the
	  softshadowmap-implementation does not compile on os x, to be more
	  precise, the shader does not compile on os x because of some
	  type-conflicts ala "can not convert from const int to const
	  float"
	  
	  So I changed the offending lines to force the type of the vars.
	  It works
	  now on OS X (albeit very slowly, 3fps on a 7300), perhaps you
	  find the
	  changes useful. Note: perhaps there is a better way in shaders to
	  cast/convert from int to float and viceversa."

2007-08-15 15:03  robert

	* src/osgViewer/Viewer.cpp: From Brede Johansen, "The attached file
	  updates the framestamp and traversal number of the
	  updatevisitor in osgViewer::Viewer.
	  
	  The bug prevented DOF animations because osgSim::DOFTransform
	  checks
	  the traversal number before doing any updates."

	* examples/osgstereoimage/osgstereoimage.cpp: From Luc Frauciel,
	  "I've done 2 main modifications :
	  1) added texture->setResizeNonPowerOfTwoHint(false); when loading
	  an
	  image. It speeds up by 10 the loading of large images.
	  2) added a --disk option : only a filelist is read, images are
	  only
	  loaded when needed. It allows to handle very large set of very
	  large
	  images that would not fit in memory. Nothing change when the
	  option is
	  not set."

2007-08-13 10:27  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/vrml/ReaderWriterVRML2.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osgSim/OverlayNode.cpp: From Jan Ciger, "I am
	  attaching an improved version of the OpenVRML plugin. It still
	  uses
	  OpenVRML 0.14.3 and is without the Boost dependency.
	  
	  The changes:
	  - - Fixed loading of textures and normals when no corresponding
	  indices
	  are specified. It uses vertex indices now, compliant with the
	  VRML spec.
	  - - Added colour per vertex support.
	  - - Added group node support.
	  - - Changed the code to use osg::ref_ptr instead of naked
	  pointers to

	  - - Fixed breakage for loading files specified by relative path."

	* include/osgShadow/SoftShadowMap, src/osgShadow/CMakeLists.txt,

	  "I have adapted to osgShadow the soft shadow map technique
	  described in "Efficient Soft-Edged Shadows Using Pixel Shader
	  Branching" by Yury Uralsky, Chapter 17 of GPU Gems 2 (Matt Pharr
	  ed. Addison-Wesley).
	  
	  Here is my code in attachment: basically, it works in the same
	  way as osgShadow/ShadowMap (core code is copied from it) but
	  implements a specific GLSL shader for the soft rendering of
	  penumbra.
	  
	  I have tested it under Linux with a NVidia graphic card, but
	  there should be no dependency on platform nor on the graphics
	  driver (as far as they support GLSL 2). Screenshots attached show
	  the current results (frame rate bound to v-sync, but the shader
	  takes actually not much time)."

	  Removed the CustomViewer in osgterrain example as the above now
	  removes the need for it.

2007-08-11 12:43  robert

	* examples/osgterrain/osgterrain.cpp: Refactored the use of the

	* src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp: From Mike Connell, "This
	  is a tiny fix for win32.
	  
	  The current code takes the mouse cursor position and adds it to
	  the
	  window (left,top) position, and sends the mouse cursor there. But
	  this
	  doesn't take into account the window decoration.
	  
	  The new code converts the given (x,y) coordinates from the client
	  area
	  coordinate system to the screen instead using ClientToScreen. I
	  think
	  this is the natural windows way to do it.
	  
	  Tested on XP with osgviewer
	  "
	  
	  Note from Robet Osfield, made a few changes to layout to make it
	  more consistent
	  with the rest of the OSG and used #if 0 instead if (0) blocks.

	  include/osgIntrospection/Reflection,
	  src/osgIntrospection/Reflection.cpp,
	  src/osgIntrospection/Reflector.cpp,
	  src/osgIntrospection/Value.cpp: From David Callu,
	  
	  "
	  Found in the join file the fix for the bug found by Rafa.
	  
	  
	  Problem :
	  
	  osgIntrospection::Value grp(new osg::Group);
	  
	  osgIntrospection::ValueList vlcall;
	  vlcall.push_back(osgIntrospection::Value("toto"));
	  
	  const osgIntrospection::MethodInfo *m =
	  grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod("setName", vlcall, true);
	  
	  if (m)
	  {
	  m->invoke(grp, vlcall); // ** SEGFAULT here
	  }
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Algorithm explanation :
	  
	  The "invoke" method try to convert "grp", which reflect an
	  "osg::Group*", in a
	  "osgIntrospection::Value", which reflect a "osg::Node*".
	  This because
	  the "setName(const char *)" method found by
	  "grp->getType.getCompatibleMethod"
	  is an "osg::Object" type method.
	  
	  When osgIntrospection do this conversion it try :
	  - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*"
	  - to found a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
	  - to converte an Enum to int or unsigned int
	  - to convert the value in its "value string representation",
	  then converte this string in the destination value
	  
	  Else it throw a "TypeConversionException".
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Bug :
	  
	  1)
	  When osgIntrospection try to found a chain of
	  "osgIntrospection::Converter"
	  It could do any downcast or (Type to SuperType) or upcast
	  (SuperType to Type).
	  This mean the the chain could be :
	  osg::Group to osg::Transform to osg::Camera to
	  osg::CullSettings to osg::CullStack to
	  osg::CollectOccludersVisitor to
	  osg::NodeVisitor to osg::Referenced to osg::Object
	  
	  During the convertion with this chain, A METTRE failed and
	  the pointer in
	  "grp" is set NULL. But the "grp" is always a valid
	  "osgIntrospection::Value"
	  and so, osgIntrospection accept the conversion. Then it try
	  to use this pointer
	  to call the "setName" function. And Bing SEGFAULT.
	  
	  
	  2)
	  In "bool Reflection::accum_conv_path( ... )"
	  the convection path isn't accumulate in the recursive loop.
	  this cause multi request of a conversion path, and a
	  slowdown in the
	  conversion algorithm.
	  
	  3)
	  Use of the last conversion way in a conversion from
	  pointer to pointer
	  this mean you can do this :
	  "osg::Node*" to " value string representation" to
	  "osg::Material*"
	  What a bad thing !!!
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  Solution :
	  
	  1)
	  Introduce the concept of dynamic_cast and static_cast.
	  now, to do a conversion, osgIntrospection does this :
	  
	  - to found a "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "osg::Node*"
	  - to found a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
	  only with static_cast, downcast (Type to SuperType)
	  
	  - to found, if the source and the destination are two pointer,
	  a chain of "osgIntrospection::Converter" to convert
	  from "osg::Group*" to "one or many type" to "osg::Node*"
	  only with dynamic_cast, upcast (SuperType to Type)
	  
	  - to convert an Enum to int or to unsigned int
	  - to convert the value in its "value string representation",
	  then convert this string in the destination value
	  
	  Else it throw a "TypeConversionException".
	  
	  
	  Add the "enum CastType" to distinguish the static_cast or
	  dynamic_cast converter.
	  Add file OpenSceneGraph/include/osgIntrospection/CastType
	  
	  2)
	  add a line to accumulate converter in converter Path.
	  
	  3)
	  add a line to check if source and destination are pointer.

	  Robert Osfield,
	  
	  Stephan: "attached you'll find some modifications to the
	  GraphicsWindow-class and
	  their platform-dependant implementations.
	  
	  The problem:
	  setWindowRectangle and setWindowDecoration do not update the
	  traits-object, so, if you call setWindowRectangle on a
	  not-realized-window it will open with another size when realized
	  later.
	  getWindowRectangle reports possible wrong sizes if
	  setWindowRectangle
	  called before.
	  
	  My solution:
	  split the implementation in two parts:
	  GraphicsWindow::setWindowRectangle will update its traits-object
	  and
	  call afterwards the virtual method
	  setWindowRectangleImplementation
	  (which is implemented by the derived platformspecific classess).
	  For
	  setWindowDecoration I am useing a similar mechanism.
	  
	  I hope you'll find the submission useful, the Win32 and X11

	  osg::notify(osg::WARN) and are not loaded:
	  A8R3G3B2, G16R16, G16R16F, G32R32F and CxV8U8.
	  
	  Also added checking of not supported DDPF_BUMPDUDV (V8U8, V16U16,
	  Q8W8U8L8, A2W10U10V10 etc.) and DDPF_BUMPLUMINANCE (L6V5U5,

	* src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PrimaryRecords.cpp: From Jason Daly,
	  "We have a few OpenFlight files that used to display properly
	  with the
	  old loader, but appear very, very wrong with the new one. I
	  traced the
	  problem to the handling of the palette override flags in the
	  external
	  reference records. The current behavior for handling the palette
	  override flags for external references has different offsets for
	  different OpenFlight version (2 bytes for 14.2-15.1 and 4 bytes
	  for 15.2
	  and later). However, I believe this behavior is incorrect.
	  
	  I know that the original 14.2 OpenFlight spec (dated April 1995)
	  specifies 2 bytes between the filename and the override flags,
	  and the
	  15.4 and later specs specify 4 bytes. However, I also found a
	  14.2.4
	  OpenFlight spec (dated January 1996) that changes the
	  specification to 4
	  bytes. Also, the databases in question were created using an old
	  IRIX
	  version of MultiGen II, which wrote OpenFlight 14.2 files
	  natively.
	  These files also have 4 bytes between the filename and flags.
	  Furthermore, these databases have always worked properly under
	  earlier
	  versions of OSG, under Performer, and in every MultiGen product
	  we've used.
	  
	  This leads me to believe that the original 14.2 spec was
	  incorrect (the
	  14.2.4 spec corrected this error), and there should be 4 bytes
	  between
	  the filename and flags for all OpenFlight files version 14.2 and
	  later.
	  
	  The attached fix modifies the OpenFlight loader to behave in this
	  way."

	* src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PaletteRecords.cpp: From Jason Daly,
	  "This changes the handling of textures in the OpenFlight loader.
	  Currently, if the texture attribute file doesn't explicitly
	  specify an
	  internal format, the loader will force it to use GL_RGB, which
	  keeps
	  translucent textures (eg. GL_RGBA textures) from showing up
	  properly.
	  
	  This patch changes the default behavior to simply use the image's
	  format
	  instead of forcing a particular format."

2007-06-08 10:16  robert

	* examples/osgviewerCocoa/ViewerCocoa.h,
	  examples/osgviewerCocoa/ViewerCocoa.mm: From Eric Wing, "So,
	  something strange happened to the repo and some of this project's
	  files got messed up, most notiably the Nib and also the Localized
	  strings file. I didn't notice the latter until now so Martin is
	  missing this file.
	  
	  Anyway, the attached tar contains all new versions of all the
	  necessary files. There are cleanups and fixes to a lot of things.
	  Martin did a good job porting the thing to osg::Viewer so most of
	  the
	  code changes I made address other areas.
	  
	  Two things I noticed in the new port you might want to consider
	  as
	  feedback. First, there might be a bug with osgViewer when the
	  view
	  size goes to 0. If you play with the splitviews in this program
	  and
	  shrink the view until it is closed, and then re-expand it, the
	  model
	  doesn't come back, not even after a home() call. SimpleViewer
	  didn't
	  have this problem.
	  
	  Second, a more minor thing, this program has a
	  take-screenshot--and-copy-to-clipboard feature via Cmd-C (or Menu
	  item). I achieve this by using osg::Camera to render to an FBO
	  and
	  then copy the contents to Cocoa. To insert the camera, I
	  manipulate
	  the scenegraph so I can get the camera node in and out. I end up
	  calling setSceneData at the end of eveything to restore
	  everything to
	  the original state before I started mucking with the scenegraph.
	  This
	  unfortunately, triggers a home() reset. So in this particular
	  case, it
	  make Copy look like it's changing the scene. The old SimpleViewer
	  had
	  the same problem, but I was able to work around it by directly
	  invoking the underlying SceneView's setSceneData so the home()
	  mechanism was bypassed. The viewer design seems to protect this
	  data
	  more carefully so the bypass trick won't work. My feedback is
	  that
	  maybe a flag or extra parameter can be introduced so a reset is
	  not
	  triggered if not desired.
	  
	  I have checked in a ton of Xcode fixes for the entire build
	  process in
	  general so once this piece gets checked in, hopefully everything
	  will
	  build cleanly."

	* include/osgIntrospection/ReflectionMacros,
	  include/osgIntrospection/Reflector,
	  include/osgIntrospection/Type: From Mike Wittman, "This change to
	  genwrapper and osgIntrospection gives access to
	  the declaring file for a given type via the new member function
	  osgIntrospection::Type::getDeclaringFile. This information is
	  useful
	  in order to know what header to include when auto-generating
	  wrappers
	  for a given type.
	  
	  During the C# wrapper generator development I've been keeping the
	  declaring file configuration state up-to-date manually with
	  changes
	  to OSG, and it's proven to require substantial effort. So it
	  would be
	  extremely valuable to get this change in before 2.0 to reduce
	  maintenance
	  during the lifetime of the release. It'll also be equally useful
	  to
	  others looking to create wrapper generators using
	  osgIntrospection.
	  
	  This is a fairly simple change and was tested with a fresh
	  rebuild of the
	  entire suite of osgWrapper libraries, so it should be relatively
	  low risk
	  (fingers crossed)."

	* Xcode/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj,
	  Xcode/OpenSceneGraph/OpenThreads-Info.plist: Lots of various
	  fixes to Xcode project.
	  
	  - Adding missing header files and making sure they are marked
	  public.
	  
	  - Support to copy headers in Viewer/api into the proper location
	  in framework
	  
	  - Internalized OpenThreads build so cross-project dependency is
	  not needed. Can now delete copy of OpenThreads project.
	  Frameworks use native Xcode linking mechanism. Plugins/Examples
	  still use explicit -framework OpenThreads. Could potentially be
	  problem is old OpenThreads is on the system. This can be changed
	  to use native mechanism too, but requires some patience because
	  it is tedious to change.
	  
	  - Lots of fixes to osgViewerCocoa (something got messed up pretty
	  badly...files are missing from repo). Another submission will
	  need to readd these files back.

	* src/osgWrappers/osgTerrain/Locator.cpp: updated wrapper

2007-06-01 21:38  robert

	* examples/osgunittests/osgunittests.cpp: From J.P Delport,
	  "attached find an updated osgunittests.cpp that allows for the
	  testing of
	  the matrix.getRotate() function when a matrix contains a scale as
	  well
	  as a rotation.
	  
	  The scale can optionally be switched off, see the top of
	  testQuatFromMatrix().
	  
	  As expected, all the current methods for mat to quat conversion
	  fail
	  these new tests. When the scale is omitted, mk2 of getRotate with
	  sign
	  instead of signOrZero passes, as well as mk1.

2007-06-01 21:33  robert

	* include/osgTerrain/Locator, src/osgTerrain/Locator.cpp: From
	  Maria Ten, "The constructor method of the EllipsoidLocator of
	  osgTerrain assumes
	  that the terrain is always the Earth planet. I changed the
	  constructor
	  method to accept the Equator radius and the Polar radius like
	  parameters. By default, it assumes the Earth radius for the
	  EllipsoidLocator. I added a setEllipsoidModel method, too.
	  
	  Now, we are developing some libraries for a GIS applicacion, and
	  our
	  libraries can visualize terrains of planets like Mars. I think
	  that is
	  a interesting change."

	* include/osg/Camera, src/osg/Camera.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/RenderStage.cpp: From Wojciech Lewandowski, "I did
	  few tests to see whether adding PreDraw callback would help us
	  with SPI problems when using Viewer. Results were positive so I
	  decided to give it a try and ask you to verify and maybe merge
	  with existing codebase.
	  
	  I added _preDrawCallback member and neccessary access methods

	* include/osgViewer/GraphicsWindow,
	  include/osgViewer/api/X11/GraphicsWindowX11,
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp: From Mathias Froelich, "have
	  done an interface to change the mouse cursor in the X11 graphics
	  window.
	  The win32 implementation is still in its original shape since I
	  have no win32
	  implementation available.
	  
	  I have chosen the enum approach for the first cut. That is
	  benefitial since
	  the user does not need to track creation of mouse cursors for
	  different
	  windows and displays in presence of multiple viewer windows.
	  
	  The default set of available mouse shapes is the same set that
	  was available
	  with glut. That set served many OpenGL applications well, so the
	  hope is that
	  this is enough.
	  
	  Even though, that implementation is still extensible:
	  I have digged out the way SDL defines new mouse cursors and added
	  a still
	  documented out function prototype in the GraphicsWindow that can
	  be used to
	  extend the current implemtation for arbitrary mouse shapes. That
	  is not
	  implemented yet.
	  
	  I hope that somebody with a win32 test system can catch up that
	  implementation
	  on win32."

	* src/osgUtil/Tessellator.cpp: From Sherman Wilcox, "The issue
	  itself occurs when a model is tessellated
	  that has greater than unsigned short number of vertexes. An
	  object
	  called vertexPtrToIndexMap contains vertexes and their indexes.
	  This
	  std::map object can obviously hold a quantity that is greater
	  than
	  unsigned short, however osg::DrawElementsUShort objects were
	  being
	  created to reference these vertexes and their indexes.
	  osg::DrawElementsUShort can only hold indexes that are 16-bit
	  quantities.
	  
	  ...
	  
	  proposed_patch_2\tessellator.cpp. This solution examines the size
	  of
	  vertexPtrToIndexMap and selects 1 of 3 possible osg::DrawElements
	  objects: DrawElementsUByte, DrawElementsUShort, or
	  DrawElementsUInt.
	  The main drawback of this particular solution is the code
	  duplication.
	  However, the repair is straightforward."

	* CMakeModules/Find3rdPartyDependencies.cmake: From Olaf Flebbe,

	  1) the header detection on a directory "freetype" fails, it seems
	  to
	  need a filename: "ft2build.h" actually works.
	  
	  2) the 3rdparty I am supplying for FlightGear contains
	  freetype-2.3.4. I
	  added the correct library naming for this particular release.

	  causes the view with the HUD camera to point somewhere other than

	  previously exist. So, I wanted to at least submit this and I will
	  hopefully provide the additional capability in the near future.
	  
	  I've tested the code modifications with Visual Studio 2005. I
	  don't
	  have the means to test any other operating system, but I would
	  suspect
	  that there shouldn't be any issue (famous last words). I used the
	  test
	  files that I uploaded to the users forum to test the changes.
	  
	  In addition to the added capability, I changed the light point
	  node
	  radius to the "actualPixelSize" value in the file. Previously,
	  the
	  radius was set to half the actual pixel size (see
	  LightPointRecords.cpp). Not sure why this was the case. But, it
	  was
	  brought to my attention by a co-worker who created the OpenFlight
	  files
	  and was testing them with different viewers. If there's some
	  history
	  for setting the radius to half the size, then this change can be
	  omitted."

	* src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/LightPointRecords.cpp: From Charles
	  Cole, "he attached code
	  implements the LightPointSystem class to allow for the OpenFlight
	  plug-in to read and handle light point system nodes. The behavior
	  is
	  very similar to the old plug-in in that a MultiSwitch node is
	  created to
	  handle the "enabled" flag bit set in the node record. The code
	  also
	  reverts the changes for the actualPixelSize as mentioned above.
	  And
	  lastly, the code requires the previously submitted changes for
	  the
	  plug-in.
	  
	  As for the other changes, I've tested the code with Visual Studio
	  2005
	  and the files that I posted in the users forum.
	  
	  With all of the submitted changes, the OpenFlight plug-in should
	  now be
	  capable of loading files with light point system nodes and the
	  use of
	  palletized light points and non-palletized light points.

	* examples/osgkeyboardmouse/osgkeyboardmouse.cpp,
	  include/osg/TemplatePrimitiveFunctor,
	  src/osgUtil/PolytopeIntersector.cpp: From Peter Hrenka, (note
	  from Robert Osfield, renamed GenericPrimitiveFunctor mention
	  below to TemplatePrimitiveFunctor).
	  
	  "Since we desperately needed a means for picking Lines
	  and Points I implemented (hopefully!) proper geometrical tests
	  for the PolytopeIntersector.
	  
	  First of all I implemented a new "GenericPrimiteFunctor"
	  which is basically an extended copy TriangleFunctor which also
	  handles Points, Lines and Quads through suitable overloads of
	  operator(). I would have liked to call it "PrimitiveFunctor"
	  but that name was already used...
	  I used a template method to remove redundancy in the
	  drawElements method overloads. If you know of platforms where
	  this will not work I can change it to the style used
	  in TriangleFunctor.
	  
	  In PolytopeIntersector.cpp I implemented a
	  "PolytopePrimitiveIntersector" which provides the needed
	  overloads for Points, Lines, Triangles and Quads to
	  the GenericPrimitiveFunctor. This is then used in the
	  intersect method of PolytopeIntersector.
	  
	  Implementation summary:
	  - Points: Check distance to all planes
	  - Lines: Check distance of both ends against each plane.
	  If both are outside -> line is out
	  If both are in -> continue checking
	  One is in, one is out -> compute intersection point (candidate)
	  Then check all candidates against all other polytope
	  planes. The remaining candidates are the proper
	  intersection points of the line with the polytope.
	  - Triangles: Perform Line-Checks for all edges of the
	  triangle as above. If there is an proper intersection
	  -> done.
	  In the case where there are more than 2 polytope
	  plane to check against we have to check for the case
	  where the triangle encloses the polytope.
	  In that case the intersection lines of the polytope
	  planes are computed and checked against the triangle.
	  - Quads: handled as two triangles.
	  
	  This is implementation is certainly not the fastest.
	  There are certainly ways and strategies to improve it.
	  
	  
	  I also enabled the code for PolytopeIntersector
	  in osgkeyboardmouse and added keybindings to
	  switch the type of intersector ('p') and the picking
	  coordinate system ('c') on the fly. Since the
	  PolytopeIntersector does not have a canonical
	  ordering for its intersections (as opposed to
	  the LineSegementIntersector) I chaged the
	  implementation to toggle all hit geometries.
	  
	  
	  I tested the functionality with osgkeyboardmouse
	  and several models and it seems to work for
	  polygonal models. Special nodes such as billboards
	  do not work.
	  
	  
	  The next thing on my todo-list is to implement
	  a an improved Intersection-Structure for the
	  PolytopeIntersector. We need to know
	  which primitives where hit (and where).

	  quicktime-plugin has an implementation of applyLoopingMode which
	  sets
	  some flags for the quicktime, so that quicktime handles the loop

2007-05-15 11:31  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt, examples/osgsimpleviewerQT4/CMakeLists.txt: From
	  Mathieu Marache, "I tried the latest developper release 1.9.4 and
	  found that I hadn't
	  the osgsimpleviewerQt4 example in my Visual studio solutions...
	  After
	  looking into it it seems that you cannot have both Qt3 and Qt4
	  enabled. After modifying the root CMakeLists.txt to use :
	  
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt) which should ask you to choose betwwen Qt3 and
	  Qt4
	  if you have both
	  
	  instead of :
	  
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt3)
	  FIND_PACKAGE(Qt4)
	  
	  I had the project generated. But then due to the way CMake
	  handles Qt4
	  I had to modify osgsimpleviewerQt4's CMakeLists.txt to have the
	  binary
	  link with QtOpengl4. "

2007-05-15 11:25  robert

	* include/osg/State, src/osg/State.cpp: From Farshid Lashkari, "I
	  made a modification to the setClientActiveTextureUnit and
	  setActiveTextureUnit methods of osg::State so they return false
	  if the
	  texture unit is outside the range of allowable units for the
	  driver.
	  Currently, the functions would return true even if the units are
	  invalid. This would cause the osg::State to become out of sync
	  with
	  the actual driver state, which can cause some bugs in certain
	  cases.
	  
	  The change I made would verify that the unit passed to
	  setClientActiveTextureUnit is below GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS, and
	  the
	  unit passed to setActiveTextureUnit is below
	  max(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_COORDS,GL_MAX_COMBINED_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNITS). I
	  modeled this behavior from the OpenGL docs for these commands
	  which
	  can be found here:
	  
	  http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glClientActiveTexture.xml
	  http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glActiveTexture.xml

	* include/osgDB/Output, src/osgDB/Output.cpp,
	  src/osgDB/Registry.cpp: From Mike Weiblen, with mods of using
	  references by Robert Osfield for efficiency. Submission notes
	  from Mike:
	  "By repurpose, I'm creating a new plugin that uses much of the
	  .osg fileformat,
	  but with some changes. Specifically, I'm creating a ".osgfs"
	  plugin, which
	  represents the scenegraph hierarchy as a filesystem of nested
	  subdirectories and
	  individual files for each node, rather than nested braces with
	  everything in a
	  single monolithic file. I intend to incorporate file alteration
	  monitor events
	  to watch the filesystem for modifications and automatically
	  reload.
	  
	  The problem I'm running into is osgDB is too tightly coupled to
	  the .osg format.
	  osgDB::Output::writeObject() contains literal .osg
	  format-specific strings like
	  "{" to represent the Object hierarchy at too low a semantic
	  level. I propose
	  using virtual methods; my plugin can then derive from
	  osgDB::Output and
	  represent Object hiearchy differently.

	* include/osgDB/Registry, src/osgDB/Archive.cpp,
	  src/osgDB/Registry.cpp: From Alan Harris, "Registry and Archive
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  This is a simple change to permit databases other than those
	  named
	  "*.osga" to be used. It is hardcoded in read() at present.
	  
	  It is non-critical and does not affect existing program
	  functionality.
	  
	  Registry and Registry.cpp
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	  Added a new typedef: typedef std::vector< std::string>
	  ArchiveExtensionList;
	  
	  a list of extensions: ArchiveExtensionList _archiveExtList;
	  
	  and an "add" method: addArchiveExtension(const std::string ext)
	  
	  This is initialised by adding "osga" in Registry() and used in
	  Registry::read() where the list is searched for the extension
	  used.
	  
	  Archive.cpp
	  ~~~~~~~~~~~
	  This submission is a little more tentative. openArchive() is
	  modified to
	  automatically add the filename extension to the Registry
	  extension list.

	* CMakeLists.txt, CMakeModules/FindOpenThreads.cmake,
	  CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake: From Eric Wing,
	  "
	  Here are more changes for the CMake scripts:
	  
	  - I removed CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX in FindOpenThreads as a follow
	  up to
	  the discussion thread.
	  
	  - I introduced an experimental CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH to replace it.
	  
	  - I added CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, and
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to the CMake GUI so users can enter values
	  there
	  instead of in the environment.
	  
	  - I added OPENSCENEGRAPH_*_VERSION variables (MAJOR, MINOR,
	  PATCH).
	  These should be kept up-to-date with the real version numbers.
	  Mac
	  bundles like to have version information so users can find out
	  the
	  version they are running through standard About panels and also
	  automated system reporters for troubleshooting/bug tracking. In
	  theory, this information could be used for library versioning.
	  We should do the same for OpenThreads, but I forgot about it.
	  
	  - I added some Mac Info.plist stuff (which uses the version
	  information).

	* src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowCarbon.cpp,
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp,
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowX11.cpp: From Martin Aumueller, "
	  a collegue of mine noticed that on Windows and X11 the modifier
	  state (such as
	  Alt or Ctrl) would be applied one key press too late: e.g. press
	  & hold Alt,
	  press a, release Alt, press a, press a would generate the key
	  sequence a,
	  Alt-a, a instead of Alt-a, a, a.
	  
	  The problem is also present on Carbon. Moving the call to
	  setModKeyMask in
	  front of the call to keyPress fixed it for me on Carbon and X11.
	  I suppose
	  that this will fix the problem for Windows as well."

2007-04-25 09:21  robert

	* CMakeModules/FindOpenThreads.cmake: From Eric Wing,
	  "These enhancements make it much easier to control which
	  libraries get
	  found by FIND_ using environmental variables. The problem with
	  the old
	  script was that CMake searches what it considers system paths
	  first.
	  This makes it difficult to override in the case where you might
	  have a
	  stable version in /usr/local, but are trying to build a bleeding
	  edge
	  release in the non-standard location /bleeding-edge.
	  
	  I went to the CMake mailing list hoping to find a good solution
	  to
	  this. Unfortunately, there isn't one, and I have to do something
	  rather bone-headed in the Find module. Basically, I have to run
	  FIND_
	  twice: once with default search paths turned off and my
	  environmental
	  variables listed, and again with standard search paths reenabled.
	  At
	  least it works.
	  
	  I also added a few more environmental variables, specifically:
	  OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
	  
	  These two variables address the shortcoming of OPENTHREADS_DIR in
	  the
	  case where the include path and library path don't share a common
	  parent.
	  
	  Put all this together, and you can setup an automated shell
	  script or
	  Microsoft .bat file to configure and build your application in an
	  automated step.
	  
	  
	  You still should be able to use the key CMake variables like
	  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH to find things, but it
	  will
	  occur after the environmental paths are searched. The reason for
	  this
	  is that the OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR and OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
	  are
	  more specific. This prevents the accidental ordering problem
	  where you
	  might use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to find some other component like
	  GLUT,
	  but didn't want to accidentally include an older version of
	  OpenThreads located in the same area.
	  
	  As the ultimate override, you can still pass -DVAR=value
	  arguments to
	  cmake and it will take these above all else. However, it's safer
	  for
	  people to not use these in case we modify the script and change
	  the
	  variable names.
	  
	  Finally, I'm wondering if we can kill the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
	  searches in the Find module. As I've said before, this is kind of
	  a
	  hack and the variable wasn't really intended to be used in this
	  way.
	  And I just got bitten by it in some bad corner cases. The problem
	  is
	  that if you don't explicitly set the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX},
	  CMake
	  sets a default value for it (such as /usr/local). The problem is
	  that
	  /usr/local may not be the place you want searched. If you wait to
	  set
	  the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} in the ccmake GUI, then FIND_ is
	  already
	  run once on ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local. If you were
	  planning to
	  change the value in the GUI, it's too late if you had a stuff in
	  /usr/local because FIND_ already found something and won't change
	  the
	  value when you reconfigure since it is already set. You will have
	  to
	  manually change the value yourself. Furthermore, as another
	  problem
	  example, on the Mac, /Library/Frameworks is supposed to be
	  searched
	  before /usr/local, but ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} kept causing stuff
	  in
	  /usr/local to be hit first which took me a really long time to
	  understand how this was happenning. The work around is that I
	  must
	  push the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} search to the very end as not to
	  conflict with anything else. But I think it would be much better
	  if we
	  removed it entirely.
	  
	  And with so many different environmental variables at our
	  disposal, I
	  don't think we need this one:
	  
	  (Checked by CMake automatically:)
	  CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
	  CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
	  CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
	  CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
	  PATH
	  LIB
	  
	  (Checked by us:)
	  OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY_DIR
	  OPENTHREADS_DIR
	  OSG_INCLUDE_DIR
	  OSG_LIBRARY_DIR
	  OSG_DIR

	  In this case, it happened to work out to still be correct, but in
	  general it shouldn't have the ${}. (I really hate this syntax.)"

	  - the geometry is not two times on the output file (!)
	  - SoVRMLImageTexture: VRML texture support was rewritten

	* CMakeLists.txt, CMakeModules/FindOpenThreads.cmake: From Eric
	  Wing, "Adding back missing search paths in FindOpenThreads.cmake.
	  Also fixed
	  a bug regarding when to set the debug version. It waited until
	  both
	  include and library were set, but it shouldn't wait on include.
	  
	  Also added a fix to the optional warning flags."

2007-04-12 09:59  robert

	* CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake,

	  SETUP_COMMANDLINE_APPLICATION and SETUP_COMMANDLINE_EXAMPLE
	  macros

2007-04-12 09:33  robert

	* CMakeModules/OsgMacroUtils.cmake,
	  applications/osgversion/CMakeLists.txt,
	  examples/osgunittests/CMakeLists.txt: From Eric Wing,
	  "Attached is a patch allows access access to the CMake
	  MACOSX_BUNDLE
	  option. Now SETUP_APPLICATION and SETUP_EXAMPLE take an
	  additional
	  optional parameter that specifies if the program is a command
	  line
	  application or a GUI application (think: IS_COMMANDLINE_APP).
	  Passing
	  1 means true (is_commandline_app). Passing 0 or omitting the
	  parameter
	  means false.
	  
	  I changed the scripts for osgversion and osgunittests to support
	  this
	  option because I believe they are command line apps. Are there
	  any
	  others?"

	  src/osgTerrain/GeometryTechnique.cpp,
	  src/osgTerrain/TerrainNode.cpp: Added support for multiple colour
	  layers, and fixed handling of elevation
	  and colour layers having different locator

2007-04-11 08:35  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt: From Eric Wing,
	  "
	  Changes include:
	  
	  A internal cache flag that can be used to detect if this is the
	  first
	  time running the CMake configuration. This is needed to work
	  around
	  stupid CMake UI shortcomings about the UI not reflecting anything
	  you
	  SET unless you use FORCE. But if you use FORCE, you override
	  anything
	  the user may try to set/override unless you have an exception
	  check.
	  It turns out the exception check you need is often the first-run
	  check. This flag is potentially useful for other things too.
	  
	  An optional switch that turns on more aggressive warnings based
	  on
	  your compiler.
	  
	  Some Apple specific stuff for detecting the OS version and
	  enabling
	  Universal Binaries (and some additional compiler flags that are
	  good
	  but gcc version dependent). The version check code is
	  unfortunately
	  really fragile. I need to lobby CMake to return the OS X version
	  number for us. FYI, building Universal will fail with the current
	  CMake release due to a bug, but is now fixed in CVS.

2007-03-26 13:00  robert

	* include/osg/ShapeDrawable: From Mike Wittman, "This is another

2007-03-16 14:28  robert

	* include/osgIntrospection/Reflection,
	  include/osgIntrospection/Value: From David Callu, " bug:
	  Lost the functionality to find the real type pointed by a
	  pointer.
	  Ex: a osg::Node pointer point on a osg::Group, if I look for
	  information
	  on the pointer type, the introspection say it is a "osg::Node*".
	  But if I want information on the pointed type,
	  the introspection must return the "osg::Group".
	  
	  
	  This bug come from the
	  osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function.
	  In the original version, this function use the member
	  "Instance_base *inst_"
	  like this :
	  typeof(*static_cast<Instance<T> *>(inst_)->_data)
	  
	  But in the new version, this function use the template argument
	  "T":
	  typeof(typename remove_pointer<T>::type)
	  
	  This is a good meta-programming use, but here we need a dynamic
	  request.
	  
	  Moreover the "typeof" macro define in "Reflection" header accept
	  only a type in parameter with the new version.
	  
	  
	  
	  fix:
	  Add the macro "typeofvalue" in "Reflection" header which accept a
	  value or a type in parameter.
	  Restore original code in
	  osgIntrospection::Value::Ptr_instance_box::ptype() function.

	* src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PrimaryRecords.cpp: From Brede
	  Johansen, Thanks for the model it helped to understand the
	  problem. In Creator the "Last Frame Duration" is performed on the
	  last frame of the last loop iteration, I tried to use it for the
	  last frame of every loop iteration. As you already have explained
	  we need a custom Sequence node. In the osgSim nodekit we already
	  have a couple of specialized nodes for the OpenFlight format. We
	  need an osgSim::GroupAnimation but I don't have the time right
	  now to take this challenge. Until then I have modified my last
	  attempt to work with the current osg::Sequence node by ignoring
	  the "Last Frame Duration".

2007-02-21 20:47  robert

2007-02-21 15:15  robert

	  "I'm happy to release the osgdragger nodekit to the OSG
	  community. I
	  implemented the nodekit for my company, Fugro-Jason Inc., and
	  they
	  have kindly agreed to open source it.
	  
	  The nodekit contains a few draggers but it should be easy to
	  build new
	  draggers on top of it. The design of the nodekit is based on a
	  SIGGRAPH 2002 course - "Design and Implementation of Direct
	  Manipulation in 3D". You can find the course notes at
	  http://www.pauliface.com/Sigg02/index.html. Reading pages 20 - 29
	  of
	  the course notes should give you a fair understanding of how the
	  nodekit works.
	  
	  The source code also contains an example of how to use the
	  draggers."

	* include/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32,
	  include/osgViewer/StatsHandler,
	  src/osgViewer/GraphicsWindowWin32.cpp: From André Garneau, "
	  
	  
	  
	  * Setup proper pixel format for ATI boards (removal of
	  WGL_SWAP_METHOD_ARB specification from the requested pixel format
	  since unsupported by the ATI driver)
	  
	  * Fix to create sample OpenGL window on the proper display
	  device. This is the temporary window used to choose the desired
	  pixel format. In the previous version, this window was always
	  created on the primary display device, even though it had
	  potentially different pixel formats compared to the target
	  display device containing the window to be created.
	  
	  * Implementation of
	  WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenResolution() method
	  
	  * Implementation of
	  WindowingSystemInterface::setScreenRefreshRate() method
	  
	  * Implementation of GraphicsWindow::requestWarpPointer() method
	  
	  * Implementation of GraphicsWindow::useCursor() method and
	  associated trait support. This can be used in two ways; first,
	  when the graphics trait requested indicates that no cursor should
	  be present, a new cursor-less window class is used to create the
	  window. When a cursor-enabled window creation is requested,
	  another window class is used. After creation of a window, it is
	  also possible to toggle the cursor state by using the
	  GraphicsWindow::useCursor method.
	  
	  * The way the mouse behaves is now compatible with the behaviour
	  seen on X11; i.e. when pressing a mouse button, the window where
	  the pointer is located will capture the mouse input and release
	  it only after the button has been released. This results in all
	  mouse movement events being dispatched to the window where the
	  button was pressed initially until it is released. This improves
	  the interaction with graphics windows.
	  
	  
	  
	  * Preparation work has been done to support the ability of moving
	  a window from one screen to another screen and recreating its
	  rendering context when this happens. This has been tested with a
	  mix of NVIDIA and ATI cards and works properly. For the moment
	  being, this feature is commented out due to changes in the core
	  OSG libraries that have been done but need to be submitted later
	  this week for approval by Robert.
	  
	  
	  
	  Upcoming features
	  
	  
	  
	  * Support for moving windows from one screen to another screen
	  seamlessly
	  
	  
	  
	  * Ability to set the window (i.e. the application itself creates
	  the rendering window and passes it to the GraphicsWindowWin32
	  class)
	  
	  
	  
	  * Other miscellaneous items"

	* src/osgPlugins/txf/TXFFont.cpp: From Mathias Fröhlich, "Attached

	  of the other I can only see differences due to different
	  mipmapping ...
	  
	  That is it introduces an additional gap of 0.1*height between the
	  glyphs.
	  There is an additional mapping between upper and lowercase
	  characters if one
	  of them is not available in the txf file.
	  And we have an artificial blank character that is very often

	  stream. There is a #define QT_HANDLE_IMAGES_ALSO mechanism to
	  indicate whether to use it for images or not. This is defined by
	  default on Mac only, to avoid conflicts with the standard windows
	  plugins. See comments on QTUtils.h
	  
	  * de-initialization of quicktime before exit is now left to an
	  observer, which calls exitQuicktime() when last media loaded with
	  the plugin is released. This prevent a crash on exit without need
	  of any extra call external to the plugin."

	* include/osgParticle/ParticleSystem: From Tom Jolley, "There was
	  some unnecessary creation and deletion of Particle objects in
	  include/osgParticle/ParticleSystem. I replaced
	  
	  Particle(ptemplate? *ptemplate: _def_ptemp)
	  
	  with
	  
	  ptemplate? *ptemplate: _def_ptemp

	  intersects
	  the menubar/dock
	  
	  Bugfixes:

	  + mouse-coordinates were absolute, now they are relative to the

	  known bugs:
	  + windows with decoration and in fullscreen-size are moved by the

	  a little bit, so that the titlebar is accessible/visible. So if

	* src/osgUtil/DelaunayTriangulator.cpp: From Geoff Michel, "New
	  delaunay triangulator attached. I hadn't realised that the
	  erase() method was not erase (first, last) but erase (first, one
	  after the last one you want deleted). This made a big difference;
	  however some of the edges of the terrain were not included as
	  edges in the terrain so I increased the size of the
	  supertriangle, which works but reduces accuracy due to the larger
	  range of coordinates in the supertriangle. (A larger
	  supertriangle forces the triangles using supertriangle vertices
	  to be long and thin, making the triangulation fit the convex hull
	  of the terrain.)
	  
	  The loss of accuracy should not affect 'normal' users with
	  terrains that are roughly square (say up to 100:1 aspect ratio)
	  and where the Z range is comparable to the X-Y range. Retested
	  with Pauls data, amalric's strange polygon constraint and the
	  standard test constraints.
	  
	  I also added 2 tests for routines with a NULL argument passed to
	  them (no-one would usually pass a NULL pointer to these routines
	  unless - as I did in testing- you remove some of the constraints
	  but still pass their pointer to the routine). And I removed 3
	  tests for triangles which are already removed when generating the
	  geometry.
	  
	  NB Paul - the previous delaunay triangulator fails under VS8 IF
	  it has any constraints as it attempts to use some vertices that
	  have already been deleted when applying the constraints to edges.
	  Under VS6 and less rigorous compilers it works as the deleted
	  vertices are still in the points stl::Vector; however any added
	  vertices would replace one of the supertriangle vertices with
	  non-disastrous but wrong results."
	  
	  Note, merged with latest name changes in CVS.

	  The existing code uses a map with object ID's. The original code
	  only applied the name to a node for a new ID only if the node did
	  not already exist in the map. The problem was that there was
	  another part of the code (when a parent was forward declared)
	  that also created the node with the ID in the map, but it did not
	  know its name. I simply made sure that the name was set
	  regardless of whether or not the node was already in the map. "

	* src/osgPlugins/dae/daeWMaterials.cpp: From Roger James,"I have
	  had another go at the windows specific file name handling in
	  daeWMaterials.cpp. I think I have arrived at a temporary
	  compromise.
	  
	  I have decided to just normalise the drive letter part of file
	  names for the time being and also ensure that names of the format
	  x:/xxxxx are treated as absolute paths. This will cover a lot of
	  cases.
	  
	  I have raised a bug against collada which hopefully should
	  resolve some others. However there are some pathological cases
	  which I have commented on in the code, these will probably never
	  work properly unless there is a significant rewrite of the daeURI
	  functionality. Hopefully they are rare."

2006-12-05 16:45  robert

	* src/osg/ProxyNode.cpp: From Rein Kadijk, "While displaying a
	  certain scene, OsgEdit crashed in ProxyNode::traverse() in file
	  OSG_OP_OT-1.2\OpenSceneGraph\src\osg\proxynode.cpp.
	  It turned out that nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler() returned NULL;
	  using this pointer to call one of DatabaseRequestHandler's
	  methods is of course illegal.
	  I patched it by adding: if (nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler())"
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, reordered the addition of the
	  nv.getDatabaseRequestHandler() check to allow the
	  default traverse() to be called when no database handling is
	  attached to the visitor.

	  dxfSection classes, so their members data are correctly deleted.
	  - changed some methods signatures to pass arguments by reference
	  instead of
	  by value. The performance and memory usage are enhanced (the
	  reader was
	  clogging the heap when reading some large DXF files)
	  
	  The updated files have been compiled and tested with a variety of

	* include/osgDB/DatabasePager, src/osgDB/DatabasePager.cpp: From
	  Bryan Thrall, "Currently, the DatabasePager always loads
	  requested Nodes using the
	  default Registry Options object, but it would be useful to be
	  able to
	  request loading with a different Options object. The attached
	  files
	  allow you to do that (based off the OSG 1.2 source).
	  
	  For example, I'm implementing a loader that requires context
	  information
	  when it pages in subgraphs, which becomes significantly
	  complicated when
	  multiple scenegraphs are requesting subgraph loads with different
	  contexts (the loader needs to know which context to use, and the
	  Registry Options needs to be carefully managed so the context
	  settings
	  don't clobber each other, especially in multithreaded
	  situations). Being
	  able to pass an Options instance along with the Node request
	  resolves
	  this problem."

	* src/osgPlugins/dds/ReaderWriterDDS.cpp: From André Garneau, "The
	  file submitted includes a fix to properly support DDS textures
	  compressed under the DXT-1 format when they contain alpha
	  information.
	  
	  Under this mode, each 4x4 texel block can selectively use an
	  alpha component or none. When alpha-enabled blocks are present,
	  this is not reported in the DDPF_ALPHAPIXELS bit in the pixel
	  format flags causing the reader-writer to report the file as a
	  3-components file (GL_COMPRESSED_RGB_S3TC_DXT1_EXT). The fix
	  requires looking at each 4x4 texel block to detect the presence
	  of 1-bit alpha encoding. When such a block is found, the internal
	  & pixel formats are reported as GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT
	  instead.

	* applications/osgdem/osgdem.cpp: From Paul de Repentigny, "When

2006-11-22 20:47  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/dxf/dxfEntity.cpp: From Sylvan Marie, "I attached
	  my revised dxfEntity.cpp file from the DXF plugin with the 2
	  following improvements:
	  
	  - When all unsupported entities (SOLIDS, TEXT, ...) have been
	  filtered out
	  from a block, dxfInsert::drawScene() was crashing because it
	  assumed that
	  the block was not empty. It now returns silently so the other
	  blocks can
	  still be imported.
	  
	  - The DXF reader assumed all vertices were read first, then the
	  face
	  indices. But, from the DXF "documentation" (www.autodesk.com/dxf)
	  :
	  "Polyface meshes created with the PFACE command are always
	  generated with
	  all the vertex coordinate entities first, followed by the face
	  definition
	  entities. The code within AutoCAD that processes polyface meshes
	  requires
	  this ordering. Programs that generate polyface meshes in DXF
	  should generate
	  all the vertices then all the faces. However, programs that read
	  polyface
	  meshes from DXF should be tolerant of odd vertex and face
	  ordering."
	  So now the importer ignores the posted number of vertices and
	  face indices,
	  and uses the size of the lists instead."

	* src/osgPlugins/ac3d/Exception.h, src/osgPlugins/ac3d/Geode.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/ac3d/Geode.h, src/osgPlugins/ac3d/ac3d.cpp: From
	  Mathias Froehlich, "Improovments:
	  - does proper edge detection with the crease angle given in the
	  ac file
	  - the reader is much more verbose in case of broken files
	  - no more static variables
	  - std::stream based
	  - much faster, up to a factor of 50 for a polygonal test model
	  - if the file contains polygonal surfaces the loaded geometry is
	  still
	  polygonal as long as the polygons are convex. Concave polygons
	  are still
	  tesselated. Rationale: If the user needs triangular models he can
	  throw away
	  that extra information with the osgUtil::Optimizer himself. But
	  the read step
	  preserves as much extra information that is contained in the file
	  as
	  possible. Also the polygonal models look a bit smoother than the
	  triangular
	  ones.
	  - a huge cleanup
	  - the basic parsing logic from the original ac3d developer is
	  untouched
	  - the writer part is untouched
	  
	  The tarball contains a replacement for the src/osgPlugins/ac3d
	  directory that
	  is based on the current CVS (2006-11-13).
	  I have tested that loader with a osgconv foo.ac /tmp/xx.ive on
	  everyfoo. ac
	  file I could find (~200 from flightgear and the object database).
	  I also run
	  my flightgear development with that loader -> here I see the
	  models.
	  I run valgrind testcases on some selected models."

	  if continuous updating is set to false.
	  
	  The problem was being caused by the camera update call never
	  being made
	  if continuous updating was not set to true. This fix adds a flag
	  that
	  is set when dirtyOverlayTexture() is called and checked in the
	  update
	  visitor section of the traversal to determine if the camera
	  should be
	  updated.
	  
	  I tested the fix by making some changes to the osgAnimate example
	  program so it has continuous updating off and calls
	  dirtyOverlayTexture
	  for each frame. The overlay texture now displays properly."

	* src/osg/Switch.cpp: From Edgar Ellis, "
	  method may not take the node into consideration when computing
	  its bound.
	  
	  In this case of:
	  switch->insertChild(0, child, false);
	  switch->insertChild(1, child, true);
	  
	  child will not be used in computeBound, but will be drawn.
	  
	  Solution:
	  Changed compute bound to loop over children using an index
	  instead of an
	  iterator. This behaviour matches that of the traverse method."

	* src/osgPlugins/tiff/ReaderWriterTIFF.cpp: From Michael Henheffer,
	  "Bug: The reader would crash when trying to load a .tif image
	  that
	  contained an 8-bit color map. The crash occured at line 545:
	  
	  remap_row(currPtr, inbuf, w, red, green, blue);
	  
	  
	  Cause: The code was trying to write past the end of the buffer
	  while
	  doing this remapping. The size of the buffer is determined based
	  on the
	  value of 'format', which was 1 in this case since bitspersample
	  is
	  8(indicating a 8-bit color map). The buffer should have been
	  created 3
	  times as large since that 8-bit value is indexing a 24-bit color.
	  
	  
	  Fix: I've put in an if statement to set format to 3 if
	  'photometric'
	  indicates the tif contains a palette as the output data will
	  always be
	  24-bit color data in this case."

	* include/osgIntrospection/Attributes,
	  include/osgIntrospection/ConstructorInfo,

	  include/osgIntrospection/TypedMethodInfo,
	  include/osgIntrospection/Utility,
	  src/osgIntrospection/PropertyInfo.cpp: From David Callu:
	  
	  "
	  the main problem is the wrapper generation:
	  The PropertyInfo class use MethodInfo class to access to the
	  value.
	  When the property are define with the I_Property* macro,
	  the MethodInfo use by the property to have access to the value
	  are instancied in the I_Property* macro, but there
	  are already instantied by the I_Method* macro before
	  
	  
	  secondary problem:
	  - the function used by the property could no be customized
	  in the genwrapper.conf file
	  - an array property can't insert a value
	  - the std::map reflector (and indexedProperty in general) haven't
	  remove method
	  - about the help in wrapper ... why not ...
	  
	  
	  
	  solution :
	  To use the function define by the I_Method, I add a MethodInfo
	  variable in the I_Method0 macro
	  old macro :
	  #define I_Method0(ret, fn) (\
	  params.clear(),\
	  addMethod(new osgIntrospection::TypedMethodIn
	  fo0<reflected_type, ret >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn,
	  params)))
	  
	  new macro :
	  #define I_Method0(ret, fn, signature, briefHelp, detailedHelp) \
	  params.clear(); \
	  osgIntrospection::MethodInfo* signature = addMethod(new
	  osgIntrospection::TypedMethodInfo0<reflected_type, ret
	  >(qualifyName(#fn), &reflected_type::fn, params, briefHelp,
	  detailedHelp)); sink(signature)
	  
	  
	  
	  the osgIntrospection::MethodInfo* signature is used by the
	  I_Property macro to define the MethodInfo that it use
	  
	  so for I_Property macro :
	  old macro :
	  #define I_PropertyWithReturnType(t, n, r) \
	  cap=addProperty(new
	  osgIntrospection::PropertyInfo(osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(reflected_type)),
	  osgIntrospection::Reflection::getType(typeid(t)), #n, \
	  I_Method0(t, get##n), \
	  I_Method1(r, set##n, IN, t, value)))
	  
	  new macro:
	  #define I_SimpleProperty(t, n, get, set) \
	  get, \
	  set))
	  
	  The genwrapper has been modified in this way.
	  The method signature is define by the prototype of the method
	  For example, the "const char* libraryName();" have
	  "__C5_char_P1__libraryName" for signature
	  
	  
	  solution for secondary problem:
	  The genwrapper accept new tokens in the configuration to
	  custumize the property.
	  The new PropertyInserter and the CustomPropertyInsertAttribute
	  class has been defined
	  The PropertyRemover has been added to the StdMapReflector
	  The _briefHelp and _detailedHelp variable has been added in
	  PropertyInfo, MethodInfo and ContructorInfo class
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  modification:
	  
	  I have modify the genwrapper files
	  Configuration.cpp Configuration.h add some tokens to custumize
	  the property
	  Doxyfile.template add the comment in the output xml
	  genwrapper.conf customize some property in osg::Geometry
	  RegistryBuilder.h RegistryBuilder.cpp add the process_help
	  function (to extract help from xml)
	  TypeRegister.cpp TypeRegister.h optimize the property detection
	  TypeDesc.h TypeDesc.cpp modify FunctionDesc and PropertyDesc
	  WrapperGenerator.h WrapperGenerator.cpp modify the output
	  
	  
	  
	  
	  I also modify the fallowing osgIntrospection files:
	  
	  include/osgIntrospection/Attributes add the PropertyInserter and
	  the CustomPropertyInsertAttribute class
	  include/osgIntrospection/ConstructorInfo add the _briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp variable in the ConstructorInfo class
	  add access function for the two new variables (_briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp)
	  modify the constructor to define the two new variables
	  (_briefHelp and _detailedHelp)
	  include/osgIntrospection/MethodInfo add the _briefHelp and
	  _detailedHelp variable in the MethodInfo class
	  add access function for the two new variables (_briefHelp and

	  modify the constructor to define the two new variables
	  (_briefHelp and _detailedHelp)
	  include/osgIntrospection/PropertyInfo add the _briefHelp and

	  (_briefHelp and _detailedHelp)
	  include/osgIntrospection/ReflectionMacro remove unused
	  I_Property* macro
	  modify all I_Method macro to accept the help string

2006-10-02 15:59  robert

	* src/osg/StateSet.cpp: From Colin McDonald, "I've included render

2006-10-02 13:40  robert

	* src/osg/LightModel.cpp: From Farshid Lashkari, "The ColorControl

2006-10-02 13:24  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/dae/daeReader.cpp: From Per Fahlberg, "Attached is
	  a fix for loading the same file multiple times with the

	  application
	  matrix is read into a double matrix called mx, it was declared as
	  3x2,
	  it's now fixed to 3x3."

2006-10-02 11:47  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/dae/ReaderWriterDAE.cpp: Added SERIALIZER to
	  ReaderWriterDAE to make sure initialization is thread safe.

2006-10-02 11:38  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/dae/ReaderWriterDAE.cpp: From Andreas Ekstrand,
	  "Attached is a modified ReaderWriterDAE.cpp which creates the one
	  and
	  only DAE instance when it's first needed instead of in the
	  constructor.
	  This fixes the problem with osgdb_dae.dll not being loaded due to
	  unwanted ordering of global initialization.
	  
	  This fix and the previous fix of the COLLADA plugin might be
	  unnecessary
	  with the latest COLLADA DOM, but since many of us will probably
	  still
	  use the older version of the DOM, I guess it's better this way.
	  "

2006-10-02 11:34  robert

	* VisualStudio/osgPlugins/ESRIShape/ESRIShape.dsp: From Andreas
	  Ekstrand, "It seems my changes to ESRIShape.dsp (to create an
	  osgdb_shp.dll rather
	  than an osgdb_ESRI.dll) were overwritten by later commits to this
	  file.
	  Here are the changes again, made from the latest version of
	  ESRIShape.dsp."

2006-10-02 11:26  robert

	* include/osgParticle/ParticleSystem: From Farshid Lashkari, "There

	* include/osgGA/StateSetManipulator,
	  src/osgGA/StateSetManipulator.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osgGA/StateSetManipulator.cpp: From Chris Hanson,
	  "These changes break out the implementation of the
	  fill/wireframe/point, texture,
	  lighting and backface culling settings from the event handling
	  code in StatesetManipulator
	  into public methods. The event handler now calls the public
	  methods. This allows user code
	  to invoke this same functionality from non-keyboard event inputs
	  without clashing with the
	  keyboard-invoked functionality."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, tweaks to the above to kepp the coding style
	  the same as the rest of the OSG, also
	  made getPolygonMode() const, and updated the wrappers.

	* src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/DataInputStream.cpp: From Colin
	  McDonald, "I have corrected a byte swapping problem in the new

	  endian systems which don't require any swapping."

	* src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PrimaryRecords.cpp: From Brede
	  Johansen, "The previous submission didn't handle Objects with
	  transforms. The
	  attached file corrects this.
	  
	  I also removed the multitexture macro for the Object record. Only

	  src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/Document.h,
	  src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PrimaryRecords.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/ReaderWriterFLT.cpp: From Brede
	  Johansen, "I have added an optimization to the OpenFlight plugin.
	  By default it
	  ignores the Object records if it's safe to do so. The reader
	  option
	  preserveObject prevents this optimization.
	  
	  I have also removed the flat shading attribute set by the Object
	  record. This flag is only intended for the "Calculate Shading"
	  operation in Creator."

2006-09-04 20:43  robert

	* include/osgTerrain/DataSet, src/osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp: Added
	  support for imagery and DEM's that wrap around the dateline, this
	  required
	  two passes over the copying of imagery and DEM's to the
	  destination graphs, once for
	  the original position, and once for the wrap around 360 degrees
	  on or before.
	  
	  Also fixed the GeospationExtents constructor that was setting the
	  _max to DBL_MIN rather
	  than -DBL_MAX. This bug causesd the y axis to be computed
	  incorrectly.

2006-09-04 13:35  robert

	* include/osgUtil/RenderStage: Missing part of Farshid Laskari's
	  submission relating to CameraNode RenderOrder.

2006-09-04 13:22  robert

	  src/osgWrappers/osg/TexMat.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osgUtil/RenderStage.cpp: Updated wrappers

2006-09-04 13:15  robert

	* include/osg/CameraNode, src/osg/CameraNode.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp, src/osgUtil/RenderStage.cpp: From
	  Farshid Lashkari,
	  
	  "I've made some changes to osg which I think make it easier to
	  control
	  the render order of CameraNode's. Instead of using the built-in
	  orders
	  (PRE_RENDER, POST_RENDER, NESTED_RENDER), you can specify an
	  integer
	  order. Values less than zero are pre rendered in order. Values
	  greater
	  than zero are post rendered in order. And a value of 0 is
	  equivalent
	  to NESTED_RENDER.
	  
	  The changes should be fully backward compatible. Also, I changed
	  the
	  RenderStageList type from a vector to a list because I needed to
	  be
	  able to insert values anywhere in the list.
	  
	  The reason I made these changes was because I wanted to be able
	  to set
	  the render order of a CameraNode at runtime without having to
	  reorder
	  it in the scenegraph."
	  
	  and later in the final submission message (relating to what has
	  been finally been merged) :
	  
	  "I've rethought my implementation and came up with something a
	  little
	  better. The setRenderOrder will continue to take an enum, but
	  will
	  have an optional orderNum parameter which can be both positive
	  and
	  negative. I think this method is more intuitive and flexible."

2006-09-04 12:52  robert

	* examples/osgtexturerectangle/osgtexturerectangle.cpp: Cleaned up
	  the texture setup code.

2006-09-04 12:46  robert

	  src/osgPlugins/osg/TexMat.cpp: Added
	  osg::TexMat::s/getScaleByTextureRectangleSize feature that allows
	  one to use the osg::TexMat to automatically scale non dimensional
	  tex coordinats to
	  the size of the last texture rectangle applied.

2006-09-04 06:51  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/scale/ReaderWriterSCALE.cpp: From Farshid

2006-08-31 20:48  robert

	* src/osg/GLExtensions.cpp: From Eric Wing, "Attached is a change
	  for GLExtensions.cpp that allows OS X to use
	  dlopen/dlsym instead of NS*Symbol* functions for 10.3 or later.
	  The
	  latter is now deprecated.
	  
	  I'm not completely sure how to test the changes. But I compiled
	  these
	  new changes in and ran the osgvertexprogram and osgshaders
	  examples
	  and they seemed to display the same results as before.
	  
	  With respect to the use of dlopen and dlsym, I was uncertain if
	  the
	  usage should look like Sun or FreeBSD (or something else).
	  Apple's man
	  pages discourage the use of RTLD_DEFAULT so I avoided the FreeBSD
	  implementation and copied the Sun implementation. I'm not sure if
	  this
	  is correct/ideal or not."

	* include/osg/BufferObject, src/osg/BufferObject.cpp,

	  Lashkari,
	  "I was experiencing hard crashes of my application when using
	  PBO's on
	  machines that don't support PBO's. I think osg incorrectly checks
	  if
	  PBO's are supported.
	  
	  I added a new method to the BufferObject::Extensions class which
	  returns if the "GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object" string is supported.
	  This
	  fixes the problem on my end. Machines without PBO support will
	  continue to work and machines with PBO support will still be able
	  to
	  use it."

2006-08-25 08:42  robert

	* Xcode/OpenSceneGraph/OpenSceneGraph.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
	  From Eric Wing, updates to Xcode project

2006-08-24 20:16  robert

	* include/osg/Math: From David Guthrie, "I know there are 50,000
	  changes to osg/Math for OSX a day, but I
	  think it can be simplified quite a bit. The old code includes
	  <cmath> for pre-10.2 and anything using something other than g++
	  4
	  and then uses std::isnan. For the most current version, it leaves
	  out cmath and uses isnan(). std::isnan and cmath work for the
	  current version, so I just made it include cmath if __APPLE__ is
	  defined and removed the ifdef between versions of OS X for isnan
	  related things.
	  
	  This way the code is all the same, and it's not fragile to
	  someone
	  including <cmath> prior to including osg/Math."

	  I also forward declared the GDALRasterBand class in the DataSet

2006-07-27 15:23  robert

	* src/osg/Matrix_implementation.cpp: From David Spilling,
	  "Matrix_implementation.cpp modified as requested. I ran a version
	  of it through a local version of osgunittests.cpp and it passes.
	  
	  Note that firstly it always returns the positive real quaternion
	  (positive w)
	  
	  Note also that it will sometimes slightly differ from the results
	  of the other methods because it assumes that the input matrix
	  really is a rotation matrix - if it isn't, e.g. because of
	  rounding error, then the output quaternion will be very slightly
	  different. For example, the test matrix
	  
	  0 1 0 0
	  1 0 0 0
	  0 0 0.999999 0
	  0 0 0 1
	  
	  will return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0005033 0.0005033
	  
	  whereas the previous methods return 0.707107 0.707107 0.0 0.0
	  
	  However, since quaternions are rotations, the meaning of how to
	  convert a matrix that isn't a rotation is a little unclear..."

2006-07-27 11:22  robert

	* VisualStudio/osgPlugins/ESRIShape/ESRIShape.dsp: From Andreas
	  Ekstrand, "The ESRIShape plugin needs to produce a osgdb_shp.dll

	  when
	  loading shp files. A new dsp file is attached to this mail. Also,

	  "There was a typo in "int setNotifyOffset()", appear to be a

	  "int getNotifyOffset()".
	  
	  Then I have added a switch to create GDALTermProgress only when

	  current notify level + local offset permit message display. In
	  fact, if
	  the offset is set to 0 and the notify level is at the default,
	  DataSet
	  is quiet but for the GDALTermProgress. That is quite disturbing
	  since
	  you think the progress is related to the complete processing but
	  it is
	  actually only related to the GDAL Warp."

	* src/osgText/Text.cpp: From Vivek Rajan, "Rotated text in

2006-07-05 21:52  robert

	* src/osg/Texture.cpp: From Eric Sokolowsky, "The attached
	  Texture.cpp fixes a problem when subloading compressed
	  textures. Near the top of the function that implements texture
	  subloading, osg::Texture::applyTexImage2D_subload(), the local
	  variable
	  compressed_image examines the _image's_ pixel format to see if it
	  is
	  compressed. However, further on, in calls to getCompressedSize()
	  the
	  _texture's_ pixel format is used. In my application's Texture2D
	  class,
	  I use osg::Texture::USE_ARB_COMPRESSION to
	  osg::Texture2D::setInternalFormatMode(), which causes the
	  internal format
	  to become one of the generic ARB_COMPRESSED types, which do not
	  have a
	  specific size. Thus the recent warning message added to
	  osg::Texture::getCompressedSize() is triggered. The correct
	  behavior is
	  to use the format mode from the Image class instead of the
	  Texture class
	  within the subload implementation, and then the size is
	  calculated
	  correctly."

2006-07-05 13:44  robert

	* src/osg/Texture.cpp: From Eric Sokolowsky, "There is code in
	  Image.cpp that calculates the size of a compressed image
	  based on the internal format. There is similar code in the
	  Texture class
	  but it does not account for the ARB types. I modified the Texture
	  class
	  implementation to show a warning when an incomplete internal
	  format is
	  used to calculate the image size."

	  src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/PrimaryRecords.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/OpenFlight/ReaderWriterFLT.cpp: From Paul Martz,
	  
	  "Previously, the new OpenFlight plugin only allowed ext ref
	  models to use
	  their own palettes. With this change, parent models can override
	  child model
	  palettes with the parent palettes.
	  
	  These changes are made against very current CVS (just updated
	  about 1/2 hour
	  ago, eliminated conflicts, and retested before this posting).
	  
	  To regurgitate what I did:
	  
	  A new class, ParentPools (public osg::Referenced), is created
	  when an ext
	  ref record is parsed, and it is populated with any parent model
	  pools that
	  should override the child model pools (according to bits in the
	  ext ref
	  record). The ParentPools object is then set as UserData on the
	  ProxyNode
	  corresponding to the ext ref.
	  
	  When the ReadExternalsVisitor hits the ProxyNode, it takes its
	  UserData and
	  sets it as UserData in the Options parameter to the
	  osgDB::ReadNode call,
	  which then read the ext ref model. In the course of parsing the
	  Options
	  string, ReaderWriterFLT also looks at the Options UserData and
	  sets the
	  parent pools in the Document class accordingly.
	  
	  When palette records are encountered while loading a file, they
	  are ignored
	  if the corresponding pool was set by the parent.
	  
	  Thanks to Brede for consulting with me on the implementation.

	  I think there was a bug in the windows-implementation of
	  scroll-wheel
	  support (wrong order of ScrollingMotion-enum, casting problem)
	  which is
	  fixed now.
	  
	  The scrollwheel-code is a bit klunky across platforms, some
	  devices on
	  OS X can report an absolute delta in pixel-coordinates not only
	  the
	  direction, so for now there is scrollingMotion (which describes

	  email comments from Andew Sampson,
	  
	  "I've contacted Terrex, and obtained the 2.2 version
	  of their trpage library. The library included a
	  fork of OSG 0.9.8's txp plugin, modified to load 2.1+
	  txp DBs.
	  
	  I've done the work of incorporating the changes made
	  to OSG's txp plugin since 0.9.8 into Terrex's fork.
	  The forked version is now up-to-date with the changes
	  made to OSG 0.9.9 and 1.0.
	  
	  Terrex made a lot of changes (especially differences
	  in whitespace), so the diff between the forked version
	  
	  and OSG 1.0's txp plugin is yucky. I did my best, but
	  
	  keep in mind that this is the result of a 4-way merge
	  (kinda... terrex-0.9.8, stock-0.9.8, stock-0.9.9,
	  stock-1.0).
	  
	  I really want to see this forked version merged back
	  into the main OSG branch. The new features offered by
	  
	  this version of the plugin (2.1+ support, variable
	  LOD support, bug fixes) are worth the trouble."
	  
	  --
	  
	  Don Tidrow then took this code and added his work.
	  
	  --
	  
	  Robert Osfield then fixed all the warnings that abound in the
	  trpage code base.

	* src/osgPlugins/dxf/codeValue.h, src/osgPlugins/dxf/dxfReader.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/dxf/dxfReader.h: From Philipp Siemoleit,
	  
	  There are some group codes (i.e. "62") which are interpreted as
	  dxfDataType::SHORT. That's right because the dxf-specification
	  defines
	  "16 bit integer" as the type for the corresponding value.
	  But readerBase::readGroup() calls readValue(std::ifstream&,
	  unsigned
	  short). I changed readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) to
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, short). I found no group code at the
	  dxf-specs
	  which needs a "16 bit unsigned integer" value. So the
	  readValue(std::ifstream&, unsigned short) function is obsolete -
	  right?

	  "The following patch adds a multisample option to the

	  the

	  value:
	  
	  --samples <num>
	  
	  One thing to note, OsgCameraGroup would previously check if the
	  computer is an SGI and set multisample to 4. I retained this
	  check in
	  DisplaySettings to be backwards compatible."

	  src/osgPlugins/txp/TXPPagedLOD.h: From Andrew Sampson, "The
	  terravista terrain generation tool can insert references to
	  external model files into a terrapage tile. It unfortunately does
	  not update the bounding sphere of that tile to include the
	  extents of the external model. This means that if a large model
	  (such as an airfield model) is attached to a tile, the model will
	  disappear when the tile is off-screen (outside the view volume),
	  even though the model is on-screen."

	* src/osgWrappers/osgProducer/Export.cpp: Checked in the genwrapper

	  built file though since Export.cpp doesn't appear in the other
	  plugins... I have checked
	  it in here to keep the builds running, there isn't actually any
	  useful body in the Export.cpp.

2006-03-08 15:40  robert

	* include/osgGA/EventQueue, src/osgGA/EventQueue.cpp: Added

2006-03-08 15:30  robert

	* src/osgDB/Registry.cpp: From Farshid Lashkari, "A while back the
	  behaviour of extension alias' was modified so that
	  the user can override existing alias'. The change allowed for
	  circular
	  references, so the createLibraryNameForExtension would get caught
	  in

	  references."

2006-03-08 15:26  robert

	* src/osgParticle/ParticleProcessor.cpp: From Farshid Lashkari, "I
	  noticed that sometimes when a particle emitter is re-enabled, a
	  few
	  particles will appear at the location it was disabled at. The
	  problem
	  is that the previous local to world matrix is not being updated
	  while
	  it is disabled. I modified the particle processor so that it will
	  set
	  the dirty flag for the previous local to world matrix when the
	  processor is skipped for a frame, since the value will no longer
	  be
	  relevant."

2006-03-08 15:16  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/ac3d/ac3d.cpp: From Roger James, "1. Fixed a
	  problem with the caching of textures when the associated image
	  file was not in the current working directory. In this case the
	  texture object was being placed in the cache with the short
	  filename, but was looked up with the full path.
	  
	  2. Fixed a problem with the caching of textures when CACHE_IMAGES
	  was enabled. This caused a conflict is the names used to cache
	  the image and texture objects.
	  
	  3. Fixed a problem where AC3D generates surfaces with duplicate
	  vertex indices.
	  
	  4. Removed what I believe are redundant calls to the tesselator.
	  
	  5. Added a couple of asserts which should fire in debug mode if
	  my assumptions about 4. are incorrect.
	  
	  6. Removed obviously unused code. (Stuff that was commented or
	  ifdeffed out.)"
	  
	  Note, from Robert Osfield, changed the asserts to if () report
	  error using notify so we can catch errors in both optimized and
	  debug builds, but without crashing.

2006-03-02 20:31  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/ive/DataInputStream.cpp,

	  is "compressImageData". Currently it uses the jpeg plugin to
	  write the

	  which image format to use. The jpeg writer supports specifying

	  "I've made some changes to the IVE loader which will add the
	  capability
	  of saving image files inside the IVE file. Currently, only the
	  raw
	  image data is saved into the file. If your model uses jpg images
	  as
	  textures then this will cause your file size to increase.
	  
	  I've added an option that will embed the original image file into
	  the
	  IVE file. The IVE file will then attempt to read the image from
	  memory. Since most image loaders support reading from memory,
	  this
	  shouldn't be a problem. To use this new feature the user must
	  specify
	  the option "includeImageFileInIVEFile" when converting to IVE.
	  
	  I tested this out on the "skydome.osg" model that comes with OSG.
	  Using the old method, the IVE file size would be 785 KB, with the
	  new

	  Also, I've added the support for TextureRectangle's to the IVE
	  reader/writer."

2006-02-04 21:20  robert

	* src/osg/FrameBufferObject.cpp,
	  src/osgProducer/OsgCameraGroup.cpp, src/osgUtil/RenderStage.cpp:
	  From Marco Jez, " I've modified in order to make FBO mipmapping
	  work. In
	  FrameBufferObject.cpp there is also another fix: when
	  initializing a FBO
	  attachment from a CameraNode attachment, the renderbuffer's
	  format must be
	  set to the attachment's internal format, not to the image's pixel
	  format.
	  
	  Another problem is that attaching a renderbuffer to the FBO
	  through
	  CameraNode is not simple (if not impossible) if you don't intend
	  to specify
	  an Image object. Probably CameraNode could be enriched with an
	  "attach(buffer, width, height, format)" method. For example if
	  you attach a
	  color buffer as a texture whose size is different than that of
	  the
	  CameraNode's viewport you also need to attach a depth buffer of
	  the same
	  size, because the depth buffer that is automatically attached by
	  RenderStage
	  has the viewport's size. FBOs require that all attachment have
	  the same
	  dimensions, so said setup will fail if you can't specify a custom
	  depth
	  renderbuffer"

	  src/osgPlugins/lwo/Surface.cpp, src/osgPlugins/lwo/Surface.h,
	  src/osgPlugins/lwo/VertexMap.h: From Marco Jez:
	  
	  here is a patch that enables a new option named
	  "BIND_TEXTURE_MAP" in the LWO plugin. Its purpose is to allow
	  explicit binding between texture UV maps defined in the LWO file
	  and OpenGL texture units, overriding the default mechanism that
	  allocates texture units automatically. This is useful when you
	  have an UV map built in Lightwave (for example an atlas map) but
	  no textures actually using it, so you can keep the UV map (that
	  would be discarded otherwise) and add a texture later int your
	  program.
	  
	  Syntax is:
	  BIND_TEXTURE_MAP <map_name> <texunit>

	  src/osgWrappers/osgParticle/ParticleEffect.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osgParticle/SmokeEffect.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osgParticle/SmokeTrailEffect.cpp: Added the
	  ability for osgParticle::ParticleEffect to switch off the
	  automatic setup.
	  Normally the automatic setup is useful, but in the case of the
	  .osg support this automatic
	  update was forcing premature loading of imagery that wasn't
	  necessarily, and can lead to
	  reports of looking for files that arn't present.

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/LightPointRecord.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/flt/LightPointRecord.h,
	  src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp: The OpenFlight plugin was
	  crashing with pre 15.6 .flt files that contained
	  light points. This was due to the mismatch is size and fiels in
	  the LightPointRecord
	  before 15.6 and after it, the OSG's flt plugin was assuming just
	  15.6 record
	  structure. As a temporary solution I have disabled the processing
	  of light point
	  records on .flt file version before 15.6, this allows these files
	  to be loaded
	  safely, but without light points.

2005-11-18 10:03  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp: From Andrew Reyonolds : changed
	  the endian conversion code to work on a temporary
	  rather then on a flt structure to prevent repeated conversion of
	  the same value,
	  something that led to eroneously large light point string sizes.

	  required.

	* include/osgParticle/ParticleSystem: From Farshid Lashkari : "I

	  I spent some more time debugging and it turns out there was a bug
	  in
	  the ParticleSystem::update_bounds function. When the bound is
	  being
	  reset, both the min and max are being set to the same postion
	  without
	  the radius being subtracted/added to it. When there is only one
	  particle alive in the system this causes it to be culled by small
	  feature culling. I've modifed the function so that when the bound
	  is
	  reset, the radius is subtracted/added to the position. This fixes
	  my
	  problem."

2005-11-08 09:36  robert

	* src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Changed the occluder traversal so that
	  checks the children of the SceneView's Cameara
	  rather than starting at the camera itself.

2005-11-07 16:52  robert

	* VisualStudio/OpenSceneGraph.dsw, VisualStudio/VisualStudio.dsw:
	  Renamed VisualStudio.dsw to OpenSceneGraph.dsw

	  event dispatch to init within selectCameraManipulator
	  to force the new minpulator to update correctly.

2005-11-07 14:42  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/obj/ReaderWriterOBJ.cpp: From David Spilling,
	  added "noRotation" ReaderWriter::Option into the .obj plugin

	  src/osgPlugins/freetype/FreeTypeLibrary.h,
	  src/osgPlugins/freetype/ReaderWriterFreeType.cpp,
	  src/osgText/Font.cpp: From Wang Lam,"The changes allow users of
	  OpenSceneGraph to call a new function
	  readFontStream() to load fonts from a std::istream, rather than
	  from the
	  local filesystem by name. Such a call may be used, for example,
	  if the
	  user has a font fetched over a network, or a font available in
	  memory
	  without a correspondng filename.
	  
	  The changes implement the new function by following the
	  corresponding code
	  for readFontFile(). readFontStream() reads a stream into memory,
	  and
	  holds that memory for FreeType.
	  
	  As a basic test, I mangled the osgtext example to use
	  readFontStream(std::ifstream("font")) in lieu of a readFontFile
	  call, and
	  the modified example ran completely."

2005-11-07 10:29  robert

	* examples/osgsimplifier/osgsimplifier.cpp: From Ruben (with a few
	  addition/changes from Robert), fixed the commandline of the

	  a copy of TXPNode.cpp with the repaired computeBounds call. I
	  discovered that TXPNodes were being culled out prematurely
	  because the
	  loaded sub-tiles resulted in a computed bounds that was smaller
	  than the
	  extents indicated in the archive. I think this fix should be
	  fine. I can't
	  think of any reason why we would want to use anything other than
	  the archive
	  extents."

2005-10-31 14:48  robert

	* src/osgProducer/OsgCameraGroup.cpp: Added default setting of

	* src/osgSim/LightPointNode.cpp: From Brede Johansen, "some tweaks
	  to the osgSim lightpoints.
	  
	  - The first change is to start fadeing a lightpoint just before

	  - The second change is to start fading a lightpoint when
	  pixelSize is
	  less than _minPixelSize instead of 1.0."

	  Mathur, "Here is an update to BlendEquation that adds checking
	  for the
	  SGIX_blend_alpha_minmax and EXT_blend_logic_op extensions. It is
	  tested with the osgblendequation example. If the extensions are
	  not
	  supported, a WARN level notification is generated."

2005-10-28 13:11  robert

	* examples/osgcamera/osgcamera.cpp, include/osgUtil/SceneView,
	  src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Moved SceneView across to use an
	  osg::CameraNode to store the projection and view matrices,
	  the viewport, the clear colour and the subgraph needing rendered.
	  This is done
	  transparently so all existing functionality will behave as
	  before. What it does
	  add is the ability to set a SceneView directly by a single
	  osg::CameraNode when required.

2005-10-28 10:33  robert

	* src/osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp: Changed debug message from NOTICE to

	  Mathur, "New functionality is the ability to automatically
	  determine the
	  maximum traversal depth necessary to obtain an accurate estimate
	  of
	  the minimum number of required cameras. In addition, the user can
	  specify an absolute maximum traversal depth that will not be

2005-10-26 20:00  robert

	* src/osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp: Changed the minimum tile image size

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp, src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.h:
	  From Tony Horrobin:
	  
	  "This is a small fix for flt2osg.[cpp|h] that handles
	  old style road segments ( from Multigen II w/road
	  tools on IRIX ) in the same way as the newer road
	  constructions. ie create a group and do a nested
	  traversal.
	  
	  This makes roads appear in older format files where
	  there was previously a gap. This actually works
	  properly with the paths which are marked as hidden in
	  the openflight database."

	  are the
	  needed changes - they work for the sample databases I have
	  available,

2005-09-28 14:18  robert

	* include/osgIntrospection/ReflectionMacros,
	  include/osgIntrospection/Reflector,
	  include/osgIntrospection/Utility: From Marco Jez, "Problems
	  fixed:
	  
	  1. type converters created automatically by the I_BaseType macro
	  use
	  static_cast<> even for base-to-derived conversions.
	  dynamic_cast<> should be
	  used instead.
	  2. as a consequence of the above fix, I_BaseType must now
	  differentiate
	  between polymorphic and non-polymorphic base classes, because the
	  latter
	  can't be dynamic_cast'd to derived classes. Some template magic
	  (see
	  is_polymorphic<> in ReflectionMacros) is used to detect
	  polymorphism at
	  compile time (I'm NOT sure it works on all platforms as it's
	  partly
	  implementation-dependent. Please test!).
	  3. predefined custom property getters/setters/counters/etc. (as
	  those
	  defined for STL containers) only work on Value objects that
	  contain
	  non-pointer instances. This was an unwanted restriction that no
	  longer
	  exists.
	  
	  Wrappers will need to be recompiled. This is a good time to give
	  them a
	  fresh update with genwrapper.
	  
	  NOTE: fix #1 should get rid of those crashes and strange
	  behaviours that
	  some users noticed while using osgIntrospection through osgTcl or
	  in their
	  own code."

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp: From Gordon Tomlinson:

	  This fixes some crashing issues I was having with certain FLT
	  files that only had partial colour palettes
	  
	  Which are typically found in older 14.x files and file converted
	  through Polytrans or Deep exploration etc.
	  
	  The code that grabs the color entries in
	  ConvertFromFLT::visitColorPalette was assuming that there were
	  full
	  palettes always coming in and stepping was out of bounds in
	  certain cases (not all) and thus crashing with
	  access violations etc,
	  
	  Although the normal from Creator is to have 1024 or 512 entries ,
	  this is not a really requirement of the format, just the way
	  Creator creates its default palettes etc.
	  
	  Code changed to look at the number of entries and use just those
	  and fills in any missing entries with a default white colour"

	  The RAW option store the RGBE values into a Image, to use
	  this option you need to decode the RGBE value in the frag-
	  ment shader. Follow the cube map glsl decoder:
	  
	  vec4 textureCubeRGBE( uniform samplerCube sampler, vec3 coords )
	  {
	  ivec4 rgbe = textureCube( sampler, coords ) * 255. + 0.5;
	  float e = rgbe.a - ( 128 + 8 );
	  return vec4( rgbe.rgb * exp2( e ), 1.0 );
	  }
	  
	  This option is usefull for who have a outdate hardware like
	  FX cards and want to do cool things.

	  src/osgWrappers/osg/TextureCubeMap.cpp,
	  src/osgWrappers/osgUtil/RenderToTextureStage.cpp: From Jeremy
	  Bell,
	  
	  "My patch is a slight refactoring of the mac specific code in
	  Registry.cpp and FileUtils.cpp, specifically around the library
	  and
	  resource file path initilialization methods. This patch cleans up
	  a
	  lot of the mac specific code by moving repeated code into
	  separate
	  local functions in FileUtils.cpp that are only compiled on mac
	  builds.
	  It also adds one function to the API,
	  appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths in FileUtils. This
	  function
	  will mirror the already existing
	  appendPlatformSpecificLibraryFilePaths except for resource file
	  paths.
	  Currently this function is empty except when built on the mac, in
	  which case it will add the application bundle's internal
	  Resources
	  folder and the bundle's parent folder. Previously this code was
	  implemented as a separate mac specific #ifdef block in
	  Registry.cpp
	  around the initDataFilePathList method. However, it now is
	  implemented
	  in appendPlatformSpecificResourceFilePaths in FileUtils.cpp and
	  the
	  initDataFilePathList method is now the same on all platforms.
	  This
	  patch should behave the same as before on non-mac platforms.
	  
	  This patch already includes the fix that Eric mentioned earlier.
	  This
	  patch is based off of the 0.99 release code. I have tested this
	  patch
	  using the following testing scheme:
	  
	  Make a proper bundled application.
	  While Run from the Finder:
	  Test that it finds plugins in its internal plugins path.
	  Test that it finds resources in its internal resources path.
	  Test that it finds resources in the bundle's parent directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the user's Application Support
	  Directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the system's Application Support
	  Directory
	  Test that it finds plugins in the Network Application Support
	  Directory
	  Check the plugin and resource path lists after they have been
	  initialized to see if they are in the correct order
	  
	  While Run from the command line (both from it's parent directory
	  and
	  from inside the /Contents/MacOS directory) and repeat the above
	  tests.
	  Check that it also finds plugins and resources within the paths
	  defined by various environment variables.
	  
	  Now, Make an application that is NOT bundled/command line only
	  Test that it does NOT try to look in an internal bundle
	  plugin/resource directory for plugins or resources.
	  Test that it finds plugins/resources in the paths defined by the
	  environment variables.

2005-06-24 20:19  robert

	* src/osgUtil/DelaunayTriangulator.cpp: From David Spilling, fixed
	  the incircle test so it handles colinear points.

2005-06-24 19:50  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/osga/OSGA_Archive.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/osga/OSGA_Archive.h: From Colin McDonald,
	  "On fixing the pointer access I discovered that reading osga
	  archives
	  containing ive files went into a cpu loop. This turned out to be
	  a
	  problem with proxy_streambuf on Solaris. Public methods in the
	  Solaris
	  streambuf standard library implementation rely on the gptr()
	  being set,
	  which proxy_streambuf was not doing. So I have modified
	  proxy_streambuf to set the input sequence pointers, and have also
	  aligned it more with the standard library streambuf
	  implementation
	  where all input is through underflow(), not uflow() which merely
	  calls
	  underflow() and advances the pointer."
	  
	  From Robert Osfield, change from using pointer cast and
	  assignment to using
	  a templated _write and _read method to avoid pointer aliasing to
	  2/4/8
	  byte boundaries that some computer system may produce. These
	  changes
	  where inspried by Colin McDonalds change to using memcpy, these
	  changes weren't merged as memcpy is not as clear in naming as
	  _read,
	  _write and memcpy will incurr a function call just for copy a
	  uint.

2005-06-24 15:39  robert

	* Make/makedefs: From Colin McDonald:
	  
	  "Some makedefs fixes for Solaris:
	  
	  For multithreaded applications the -mt option must be specified
	  on both
	  the compile and link steps, to ensure correct behaviour.
	  According to
	  the Sun compiler documentation it sets REENTRANT flags in the
	  system
	  header files, and links the -lthread library in the correct
	  order.
	  
	  When compiling shared libraries the -KPIC option should be
	  specified.
	  Although Solaris will handle shared libraries without
	  position-independent code there is a performance penalty. The
	  linker
	  reference manual says: 'If a shared object is built from code
	  that is
	  not position-independent, the text segment will usually require a
	  large
	  number of relocations to be performed at runtime. Although the
	  runtime
	  linker is equipped to handle this, the system overhead this
	  creates can
	  cause serious performance degradation'."

2005-06-24 15:34  robert

	* src/osg/Switch.cpp: From Martijn Kragtwijk: "I ran into the same
	  problems as Karl Martensson
	  (http://openscenegraph.org/archiver/osg-users/2005-June/0575.html);
	  after switching children of a Switch node off and on again, they
	  become
	  unpickable. This issue occurs first in 0.9.9, with 0.9.8
	  everything is fine.
	  My fix involves calling dirtyBound() every time the on/off-values
	  of the
	  Switch are changed"

2005-06-24 15:30  robert

	* src/osgDB/DynamicLibrary.cpp: From David Guthrie, "The call
	  NSLookupAndBindSymbol was changed to
	  NSLookupSymbolInModule. The former call would lookup the named
	  symbol NOT in the current dynamic library, but in the entire
	  running
	  program while the call NSLookupSymbolInModule, takes the handle
	  to
	  the library the symbol should be found in. This means the current
	  code will fail if one loads multiple bundles at runtime and
	  attempts
	  to load the same named symbol from each one."

2005-06-24 15:15  robert

	* src/osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp: Moved the working

2005-06-06 10:18  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/txp/ReaderWriterTXP.cpp: From Mathia Walker: bug
	  fix to LOD ranges in TXP plugin to avoid cracks:
	  
	  "I took a closer look at the conditional code in
	  SeamFinder::seamReplacement().
	  
	  Because _info.minRange is a double and lod->getMinRange(0) is a
	  float,
	  the difference will be calculated with double precision. If
	  _info.minRange is cast as a float it is exactly the same value as
	  lod->getMinRange(0) and the difference is exactly zero.
	  
	  So if you change
	  
	  
	  if((fabs(_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs(_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))
	  
	  to
	  
	  
	  if((fabs((float)_info.minRange-lod->getMinRange(0))<0.001)&&(fabs((float)_info.lod0Range-lod->getMaxRange(0))<0.001))
	  
	  it works a lot better."

2005-05-31 06:21  robert

	* include/osg/Matrixd, include/osg/Matrixf,
	  src/osg/Matrix_implementation.cpp: From Tim Daust, "I fixed the
	  getScale functions in matrixf and
	  matrixd. It was returning the values of the diagonal
	  of the matrix, which only returns the scale if there
	  is not a rotation. I fixed this by returning the
	  length of the vectors that form the basis.
	  I also added a function to orthonormalize the
	  rotation component of the matrix. I seem to always run
	  into situations where non uniform (or even uniform)
	  scale complicate my calculations, and I thought other
	  members of the community could use this function as
	  well."

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/ReaderWriterATTR.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp: From Joson Daly, fix for
	  forward/backward/swing animation handling both 15.8 and
	  versions prior to 15.8, and...
	  
	  " Here's another fix for OpenFlight. The symptom was that ATTR
	  files were
	  not being read correctly, and the TexEnv on a texture that should
	  have
	  been set to DECAL was instead defaulting to MODULATE. The cause
	  is that
	  the ATTR reader cannot tell by itself what version it's reading
	  (the
	  version information isn't present in the ATTR files), and instead
	  relies
	  on the ReaderWriter::Options passed in to get the OpenFlight
	  version.
	  
	  My change clones the current ReaderWriter::Options and prepends
	  the
	  appropriate FLT_VER option before the ReaderWriterATTR object is
	  called. I also made the parsing of the FLT_VER string and value
	  more
	  robust in the ReaderWriterATTR itself. I think I commented things

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/FltFile.cpp, src/osgPlugins/flt/Pool.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp: From Alberto Farre:
	  "Here there are fixes for several flt loader problems.
	  
	  First one was an small bug when root database was an empty string
	  we got a database path "/" instead of "./".
	  Second one is more complex. Flt loader works in two passes, first
	  one reads flt database and second one builds osg scenegraph.
	  Special care must be taken for properly tracking database path as
	  nested files are entered. Because textures are loaded in second
	  pass, mentioned care should be taken once again. I wrote time ago
	  a piece of code and I placed it in both files fltFile.cpp and
	  flt2osg.cpp. After a long period offline I have seen the portion
	  of code at flt2osg was missing, I just made some tests and I
	  could see it is still required.
	  
	  Finally, I have seen that pool.cpp always try to make IMAGE cache
	  instead of reading what Options says.
	  
	  Aditonally, I recently wrote an osg change, now it has external
	  references "a la flt" what is called osg::ProxyNode. As part of
	  the change now flt loader builds external references as
	  ProxyNodes. I made the same mistake like pool.cpp and always made
	  ARCHIVE cache instead of see what Options says, it has also been
	  fixed."

	  "COMBINE_GEODES"
	  that allows to place all geometries under a single Geode whenever
	  possible,
	  thus offering better chances of further optimization through
	  osgUtil::Optimizer. The downside is that surface names are no
	  longer stored
	  in the scene graph when using this option."

	  changes to osgParticle.
	  
	  "The first is with
	  Particle.cpp. I made a change so that when the lifetime is 0
	  (lasts
	  forever) the sizeRange, colorRange, and alphaRange are used to
	  create
	  a random size, color, and alpha."
	  
	  "The second change is with range and SectorPlacer. The
	  distribution of
	  particles across the sector was not uniform. I added
	  get_random_sqrtf()
	  function where it is used in SectorPlacer::Place(). This seems to
	  make
	  the distribution uniform (at least when minimum radius is 0)."

	  changes to
	  support OF 15.8 in the flt loader. Barring bugs, of course, knock
	  on wood.
	  
	  The gist of the animation palette code is to create ref_ptr'd
	  osgSim::BlinkSequence objects for each palette entry, and then
	  pass them on
	  to osgSim::LightPoint for any OpenFlight light points that
	  reference that

	  Input.cpp -- Here's where support for reading the continuation
	  record goes. I added a new function to read a continued record
	  body. I added
	  code in the existing ReadRecord routine to peek ahead for a
	  CONTINUATION_OP
	  if the current record could possibly be continued.
	  
	  opcodes.h -- Besides adding the opcode for CONTINUATION_OP, I
	  also added new
	  15.8 opcodes. I labeled opcodes as "ignored" if I could easily
	  discern that

	  LocalVertexPoolRecord.h, LocalVertexPoolRecord.cpp -- This is one

	  types of records that can be continued with a CONTINUATION_OP
	  record. I
	  removed all invalid assertions that assumed the record length

	  a more
	  efficient method based on caching the size from attribute bits,
	  rather than
	  taking the length of the record and dividing it by numVerts
	  (which would
	  have been incorrect if the record had been continued)."

	  coordinates on particles so that animated textures can be used,
	  with the current frame of animation being computed from each
	  particle's current age.
	  Clients just have to call Particle::setTextureTile() and specify

	  "These two files fix the alignment bug in the flt plugin header

	  email from Marco)
	  
	  "Most relevant news:
	  1) particle systems now have the "freezeOnCull" property set to
	  false by
	  default. Since it is an optimization, and using it may cause some
	  unwanted
	  behaviors if not handled properly, it makes more sense to turn it
	  off by
	  default.
	  2) new "LINE" shape mode which uses GL_LINES to draw line
	  segments that
	  point to the direction of motion.
	  3) particles can now have a rotation angle and angular velocity.
	  4) new AngularAccelOperator applies angular acceleration to
	  particles.
	  5) particle processors such as emitters and programs can have a
	  "start",
	  "end" and "reset" time coordinate. For example, an emitter may be
	  instructed
	  to start emitting particles only after a certain time, stop after
	  another
	  amount of time and then start again.
	  
	  Update (2) is from Gideon May.
	  Updates (3) to (5) are from Douglas A. Pouk."

	  (double).
	  
	  Added osg::Matrixf::glLoadMatrix() and

	* src/osgText/Font.cpp: The wrong file name was being used
	  readFontFile.

2003-03-14 02:29  don

	* src/osgPlugins/txp/GNUmakefile: Removed the building of the
	  osgTXP library so the build system builds only
	  the plugin. Building both the plugin and the library causes a
	  race condition
	  during parallel makes.

2003-03-13 14:29  robert

	* include/osg/Vec2: Reverted Don's changed of sqrtf to sqrt. Don't
	  understand why the change was
	  required, suggest a problem elsewhere which should be fixed,
	  *not* by modification
	  of Vec2.

2003-03-13 09:22  robert

	* VisualStudio/osgText/osgText.dsp: From Gabor Dorka, Added d to

	  and
	  $(OS)$(ARCH).Debug for OS's that support both architectures.
	  eg. Linux32.Opt and Linux32.Debug
	  
	  o Libraries links are now placed in lib/$(OS)$(ARCH)
	  eg. lib/Linux32/
	  
	  o Binaries are now placed in bin/$(OS)$(ARCH)
	  eg. bin/Linux32
	  
	  o 'make install' and 'make instlinks' now place files/links in
	  /usr/local/{include,lib,share/OpenSceneGraph} by default on
	  most systems (Solaris still goes in /opt/OpenSceneGraph).
	  Rather than having the somwehat confusing INST_SYS_PREFIX and
	  INST_SHARE_PREFX, you can override these with just
	  INST_LOCATION
	  For example,
	  make INST_LOCATION=/usr
	  will place files at /usr/include, /usr/lib,
	  /usr/share/OpenSceneGraph.

2003-03-12 14:01  robert

	* Make/makedefs, Make/makedirdefs: Moved the platform specific

	  should save time rebuilding dependencies by limiting the
	  regeneration
	  of dependency file for only modified source files.

2003-03-12 09:45  robert

	* src/osgText/String.cpp: Added (unsigned int) cast to the call to

2003-03-11 21:53  robert

	* include/osg/Drawable, src/osg/Drawable.cpp: Added setBound()
	  method to Drawable.

	* include/osg/State, src/osg/State.cpp,
	  src/osgProducer/KeyboardMouseCallback.cpp,
	  src/osgProducer/Viewer.cpp, src/osgUtil/RenderLeaf.cpp: Added
	  support for AbortRendering flag pointer in osg::State which is

	  by osgUtil::RenderLeaf to test if any abort state has been set,
	  if so it
	  doesn't do any further drawing.
	  
	  The osgProducer::Viewer has been set up to set the osg::State's
	  it manages
	  with their AbortRendering flag pointers set to the
	  osgProducer::Viewer::_done
	  memeber varaible. Now when escape is pressed the rendering is
	  aborted early.

	  examples/osgreflect/osgreflect.cpp: Addded new osgProducer based
	  osgreflect demo.

2003-03-10 11:59  robert

	* Make/makedirdefs, examples/osgviewer/osgviewer.cpp,
	  src/Demos/osgreflect/osgreflect.cpp, src/osgUtil/RenderLeaf.cpp:
	  Moved the RenderLeaf implementatation across to always applying
	  matrices
	  before state, which fixes problem that can occur with state that
	  needs
	  the current model view or projection matrices.
	  
	  Changes osgreflect so that it uses ClipNode rather than clip
	  plane, thereby
	  fixing the problems which occur when the above is applied.
	  
	  Create a new osgProducer version of the original GLUT based
	  version.

2003-03-10 11:57  robert

	* include/osgDB/DynamicLibrary, src/osgDB/DynamicLibrary.cpp:

2003-03-10 09:15  robert

	* include/osgText/Font, src/osgText/Font.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/TriStrip_tri_stripper.h: Moved the remain inline
	  osg::Font methods into Font.cpp to avoid problems with the
	  impossibly stupid visual studio compilers.

	  ensure
	  that they arn't created on the stack inappropriately.
	  
	  Split the implemention of Matrix up so that it is a simple no
	  referenced counted
	  class and can be safefly created on the stack. To support
	  referenced counting a
	  seperate subclass now exists, this is RefMatrix which inherits
	  from both Matrix and
	  Object.

	  graph rather
	  than the test framework.
	  
	  Have added a very simple unit test to Vec3.cpp, which are
	  optionally
	  compiled in with the OSG_COMPILE_UNIT_TESTS define, which is only
	  currently defined in debug builds under unix. It should be fine
	  to
	  add it in under Windows project files as well.
	  
	  Finally, a new demo app osgunittests runs the tests and reports
	  success
	  or failure of the tests.

	  to the .osg plugin.

2002-08-20 08:14  robert

	* src/osg/Notify.cpp: Reordered the string comparions so that

	  Made osg::Matrix/Quat::makeRotate(heading,pitch,roll) and
	  osg::Matrix::rotate(heading,pitch,roll) all deprecated API.
	  
	  Fixed the Quat*Quat & Quat*=Quat multiplication methods so that
	  they multiplied
	  in the correct order - they were reversed originally due to the
	  Quat code being
	  based on code example which used the v' = M v ordering, rather
	  than the OSG's
	  v' = v M ordering.

2002-08-18 11:16  robert

	  such as
	  osgUtil::AppVisitor/CullVisitor.

2002-08-11 10:32  robert

	  StateAttribute/State to support PROTECTED flag for modes and
	  attributes
	  so that they cannot be overriden from above via the OVERRIDE
	  flag. This is

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/TexturePaletteRecord.cpp: From Brede Johansen,
	  fix the TexturePaletteRecord::endian() to handle
	  old flt versions (11, 12 & 13).

2002-07-18 14:29  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp: From Brede Johansen
	  "I have found one bug in the ConvertFromFLT::visitFace()
	  function. In the
	  early days of the Flight format, before the LightPoint record
	  existed
	  they used face records with a light (-point) attribute."

	  PrimitiveFunctor as is now completely
	  decoupled from osg::Drawable. The Drawable::getStats() virtual
	  method
	  no longer exists.
	  
	  Updated the Viewer to use the osg::Statistics incarnation and
	  reformated stats
	  to clean it up.

2002-07-18 10:55  robert

	* src/osg/LightSource.cpp: Added code into osg::LightSource so it
	  correctly computes its bounding
	  sphere, taking into account any subgraph below, and the light
	  itself
	  if it is not a infinite light.

2002-07-18 10:49  robert

	* Make/debugtests.bat, Make/osgtests.bat: Updated the test scripts
	  to include cube mapping example and osglight demo.

2002-07-18 10:41  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp: Removed repeated return transform

	  OpenGL range of 0.0 to 128.0 instead of the previous normalised
	  shiniess
	  range. This brings it inline with the way the rest of the OSG
	  uses a
	  1 to 1 mapping to OpenGL.
	  
	  Converted the various loaders to use the new range, which is
	  almost all
	  cases was simply removing the /128.0f which was required before!

	  src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Several items of work related to
	  adding a manual creation of occluders
	  option to the osgoccluder demo.
	  
	  First the osgGA classes have been generalised a little to better
	  support
	  new GUIEventHandler subclasses.
	  
	  Second osgGLUT has a new option for registering a user defined
	  event handler,
	  the allows the application to add externally extra options to the
	  osgGLUT viewer.
	  
	  Third, the osgoccluder demo now works in two modes. The original
	  create
	  four occluder sides to wrap an loaded model, the second an
	  interactive
	  mode which allows the users to add occluders to the model by
	  pointing
	  to points and pressing 'a' to add a point, the 'e' to end the
	  occluder
	  polygon, polygons must be convex, planer and be defined in an
	  anitclockwise
	  order. To start the osgoccluder in this mode one simple runs it
	  with the
	  '-c' option. Run osgoccluder with no parameter to get a list of
	  options.

	  the final image.

2002-07-15 13:20  robert

	* Make/debugtests.bat, Make/osgtests.bat,
	  src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Fixed the orientation of the
	  osgreflect demo so that the reflection plane
	  is orientated towards the viewer.
	  
	  Changed the lightmodel ambient level to 0.1,0.1,0.1 instead of
	  0.0, so that
	  a small amount of ambient lighting is available to render back
	  surfaces.
	  The osgreflect and osgprerender suffered unexpected behaviors
	  because of
	  no lighting on the backfaces.

2002-07-15 13:14  robert

	* src/Demos/osgreflect/osgreflect.cpp: Added a MatrixTransform to
	  tilt the osgreflect demo so that the reflection
	  plane is seen clearly.

2002-07-15 13:13  robert

	* src/Demos/osgconv/OrientationConverter.cpp: Fixed the
	  optimization of the orientation conversion.

2002-07-15 11:44  robert

	* Make/debugtests.bat, Make/osgtests.bat,
	  src/osgDB/FieldReaderIterator.cpp: Fixed memory leak in
	  FieldReaderIterator.cpp.
	  
	  Updated the Make/osgtests.bat and Make/debugtests.bat scripts.

2002-07-15 10:53  robert

	* Make/makedirdefs, VisualStudio/VisualStudio.dsw: Renamed
	  hangglide to osghangglide

2002-07-15 10:51  robert

	* src/Demos/hangglide: Removed the old hangglide directory.

2002-07-15 10:43  robert

	* VisualStudio/Demos/osghangglide,
	  VisualStudio/Demos/osghangglide/osghangglide.dsp: Renamed the
	  hangglide demo osghangglide to make it consistent with the rest
	  of the demos.

2002-07-15 10:03  robert

	* include/osg/State, src/osg/GeoSet_ogl.cpp, src/osg/Geometry.cpp:
	  Added State::disableTexCoordPointersAboveAndIncluding( unit )
	  method so that
	  all unsed texture units can be turned off simply within Drawables
	  such
	  as Geometry and GeoSet. This can be used to prevent bleed of
	  arrays from
	  one object to the next - which can cause crashes.

2002-07-15 04:42  don

	  src/osgPlugins/osg/Transform.cpp: Fixes to read/write of
	  MatrixTransform/Transform.

2002-07-14 08:35  robert

	* src/Demos/hangglide/sky.cpp: Copy and Paste bug where an for()
	  loop was repeated within itself, which
	  was introduced when moving across to use osg::Geometry.

2002-07-13 21:17  robert

	* src/Demos/osgclip/osgclip.cpp, src/Demos/osgtext/main.cpp,

	  sun compilers

2002-07-12 21:45  robert

	  osgparticle demo to fix crash under MacOSX.

2002-07-12 21:42  robert

	* src/Demos/osgprerender/osgprerender.cpp: Added second texture to

2002-07-12 14:25  robert

	* VisualStudio/osg/osg.dsp,
	  VisualStudio/osgPlugins/osg/dot_osg.dsp, include/osg/BlendFunc,
	  include/osg/BoundingBox, include/osg/BoundingSphere,
	  include/osg/Export, include/osg/StateAttribute,

	  src/osgPlugins/osg/BlendFunc.cpp, src/osgPlugins/osg/Makefile,
	  src/osgPlugins/osg/Transparency.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/pfb/ConvertFromPerformer.cpp: Have added a #define
	  USE_DEPRECATED_API to include/osg/Export, and
	  various
	  osg header and source files to optional compile in deprecated
	  parts of
	  the
	  OSG API.
	  
	  Have renamed osg::Transparency osg::BlendFunc to bring it in line
	  with
	  the
	  rest of the OSG's StateAttribute classes which are named after
	  their
	  OpenGL counterparts. include/osg/Transparency still exists and is
	  simply
	  a typedef to BlendFunc and is enclosed in a #ifdef
	  USE_DEPRECTATED_API
	  block.
	  
	  The matrix methods in the osg::Transform class have been
	  moved/replicated in
	  a osg::MatrixTransform sublcass from osg::Transform. The old
	  matrix
	  functionality is still present in the osg::Transform class but is
	  guard
	  by #ifdef USG_DEPRECATED_API blocks. One should now think of
	  osg::Transform
	  as being a Transform Node base class. MatrixTransform has all the
	  functionality of the original Transform class, so should be used
	  instead.

2002-07-12 13:00  robert

	* src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Fix, sent in by Macro Jez, to the set
	  of the camera with the computed near and far plane, so that

	  Seems Red Hat 7.3
	  turns up undefined symbols without it.

2002-07-11 21:08  robert

	  paramters.
	  
	  Intergrated pfImage copying change in the Performer plugin,
	  submission sent in by Ulrich Hertlein

	  TemplateArray& t,const CopyOp& copyop).

2002-06-20 19:54  robert

	* VisualStudio/osg/osg.dsp, include/osg/Geometry,
	  src/osg/Geometry.cpp, src/osg/Makefile: Addd new experimental

	  smallest of GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE and OSG_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE is used
	  for the
	  final max texture size.
	  
	  This new env. var. allows users to deliberate cap the size of
	  their textures
	  so they can test whether their models are limited by texture
	  memory. If
	  reducing the max texture size increases performance then you are
	  limited
	  by texture memory!

2002-06-19 16:06  robert

	  volume of osg::OccluderNodes.
	  
	  Added support for
	  osg::BoundingSphere::expandBy*(osg::BoundingBox) and have
	  added osg::BoundingSphere/Box::valid() which deprecates
	  isValid(), this
	  is to be more consistent with other classes in the OSG.

2002-06-19 10:19  robert

	  src/osgPlugins/osg/LightSource.cpp, src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp:
	  Changed the osg::LightSource so its Light attribute is now
	  generalised to
	  be a StateAttribute. This allows alternative implementations of
	  Lights
	  other than the standard osg::Light.

2002-06-18 22:35  robert

	  src/osg/ShadowVolumeOccluder.cpp, src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp:
	  Added support for occluders occluding other occluders, which
	  helps reduce
	  the number of occluder that will be used in cull traversal to
	  only the
	  ones that will be effective. Note. Holes in occluders arn't
	  handled in
	  this occluder occlusion test, will implement this later.

	  for the Windows build.

2002-06-18 09:09  robert

	* src/osgDB/Registry.cpp: Added the length argument to a
	  std::string argument, under Linux it
	  compiled with the default value npos, under Windows it broke the
	  build,
	  add the npost excpilicity should get round this difference in
	  implementation.

	  Rewrote the FileUtils support for data and library file paths,
	  moving the
	  storage of the path lists into osgDB::Registry, and changed the
	  data
	  structor from a char* to a std::deque. Changed a names of couple
	  of the
	  convinience functions in osgDB/FileUtils to better reflect the
	  two
	  public FilePathList's - DataFilePathList and the
	  LibraryFilePathList.
	  
	  Added support into the osgDB::Registry::readNode/Image/Object
	  methods
	  for pushing and popping the path of the current file being
	  loaded.

	* src/Demos/osgoccluder/osgoccluder.cpp: Added occluder hole test
	  code into the osgoccluder demo. The code works,
	  but I've commented it out right now as the Geode physically

	  than links that may be pointing to files of the wrong platform
	  type.

	  during cull traversal. The maths for converting the computed far
	  and near
	  into clip coordinates was wrong, fixed this and the problem goes
	  away.

	* src/osgPlugins/dx/Makefile: Merged Bob's changes for MacOSX
	  build. This change is simply the addition of
	  GLUT_LIB to the link line. This change should be removed once we
	  fixed the
	  OSG_LIBS so that it doens't include osgGLUT, however, I'll leave
	  this for another
	  day...

2002-04-24 20:36  robert

	* src/osg/Texture.cpp: Fix for MacOSX build, making sure that the
	  compresed tex image is defined
	  on all builds by removing the #ifdef's but then changing the name
	  used
	  in the typedef so it doesn't collide with local implementations.

2002-04-24 14:52  robert

	* include/osg/MemoryManager, src/osg/MemoryManager.cpp,
	  src/osg/Notify.cpp, src/osgDB/FileUtils_Mac.cpp,
	  src/osgDB/FileUtils_Unix.cpp, src/osgDB/FileUtils_Windows.cpp:
	  Removed the use of __FUNCTION__ from MemoryManager to remove
	  problems with
	  VisualStudio .NET compile.
	  
	  Added support for OSG_NOTIFY_LEVEL and OSG_FILE_PATH into the
	  relevant getenv
	  routines. This compliments the exisiting OSGNOTIFYLEVEL &
	  OSGFILEPATH which
	  are deprecated but still supported. The OSG_ version are more
	  consistent
	  with the rest of the env variables used in the OSG.

	* src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp, src/osgDB/FileUtils_Mac.cpp,
	  src/osgDB/FileUtils_Unix.cpp, src/osgDB/FileUtils_Windows.cpp:
	  Seperated out the platform specific implementions of the file

	* src/Demos/osgbillboard/osgbillboard.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/rgb/ReaderWriterRGB.cpp: Added an
	  imageList.clear() to osgbillboard so that its memory would be
	  cleared before entering the viewer main loop, this removes
	  memorymanager
	  a reported memory leak due to the viewer using exit() which
	  bypasses
	  the clean up on main itself.
	  
	  Added an osgNew to the ReaderWriterRGB.cpp to aid detected of
	  tracking of
	  memory leaks.

2002-04-23 10:34  robert

2002-04-22 19:41  robert

	* include/osgUtil/CullVisitor, src/Demos/hangglide/hangglide.cpp:
	  Added code in hangglide to move the earth sky around with the eye
	  point,
	  use osg::Transform::ComputeTransformCallback.

2002-04-22 14:54  robert

	* include/osg/Matrix, include/osgUtil/CullVisitor,
	  src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp, src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Added
	  support for compute the near and far planes and then applying to
	  the current projection matrix into CullVisitor itself. Similar
	  code to
	  support this has been moved out of SceneView completely.
	  
	  Added Matrix:: infront of the definition of the static
	  osg::Matrix::inverse(Matrix) method which was missing.

2002-04-22 09:55  robert

2002-04-22 09:37  robert

	* NEWS, src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp, src/osgUtil/RenderStage.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Cleaned up the handling of the
	  Viewport with osg::SceneView/RenderStage
	  and CullVisitor so that the Viewport is now managed as part as
	  the global
	  stateset so that it can be pushed and popped like the rest of
	  state without
	  problems. This makes it easier to have multiple viewports within
	  one
	  scene graph.

2002-04-22 09:31  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/obj/glm.cpp: Fixes the .mlt loading from Ben
	  Discoe.

2002-04-21 22:05  robert

	* TODO, include/osg/AnimationPath, src/osg/AnimationPath.cpp,
	  src/osg/State.cpp, src/osg/StateSet.cpp, src/osgGLUT/Viewer.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Updated TODO list.
	  
	  Converted AnimationPath so it is now subclassed from
	  osg::Transform::ComputeTransfromCallback()
	  so that it can be directly attached to the scene to move objects
	  about.
	  
	  Changed the osg::SateSet::setGlobalDefaults() so that is sets
	  GL_DEPTH_TEST
	  to ON.
	  
	  Added guards and creation of default helper classes in
	  osgGLUT::Viewer and
	  osgUtil::SceneView so that sensible defaults are used when no
	  settings
	  are used of
	  osg::State/StateSet,osgUtil::RenderStage/RenderGraph/CullVisitor.

	  including the
	  project and unproject methods which are better supported within
	  osgUtil::SceneView.
	  
	  Added a computeWindowMatrix() method to Viewport, to make it
	  easier to construct
	  a MV*P*W matrix for converting local coords into screen coords
	  and visa versa.

2002-04-12 10:24  robert

	* VisualStudio/osgPlugins/lib3ds/lib3ds.dsp: Attempt to add
	  osgPlugin infront of the 3ds name to force VisualStudio to
	  present it as plugin in the browser.

2002-04-12 10:12  robert

	* VisualStudio/VisualStudio.dsw: Reorganised the names of libraries
	  and Demos to make it clear what is what.

2002-04-12 09:53  robert

	* include/osg/Transform, src/osg/Transform.cpp,
	  src/osgText/FTVectoriser.cpp: Fixes for Win32 build

2002-04-12 09:25  robert

	* VisualStudio/VisualStudio.dsw: Removed double reference of
	  osgtexture

2002-04-12 09:25  robert

	* Metrowerks: Removed Metroweks files since they wern't being used,
	  and were not up to
	  date. An attempt at using Metrowerks for MacOSX build failed, and
	  we
	  have Cywgin/Mingwin VisualStudio for windows so there is little
	  need for it.

2002-04-12 08:01  robert

	* VisualStudio/osgUtil/osgUtil.dsp: Removed dangling references to
	  NewCullVisitor from osgUtil.dsp.

2002-04-12 06:18  don

	* Make/makepkg, src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp: Solaris PKG
	  distribution now makes a shar (self-extracting shell archived)
	  changed makepgk to do this.
	  
	  Changed another one of those pesky cout = std::cout in
	  CullVisitor.cpp

2002-04-12 05:09  don

	* Make/makedefs: added 'make cleandepend' to build system.

2002-04-12 05:06  don

	* Make/help.sh, Make/makerules: Added the 'make cleandepend' target
	  to the build system.

2002-04-11 23:20  robert

	  src/osgPlugins/osg/Object.cpp, src/osgPlugins/osg/Transform.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp, src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Added
	  DataVariance enum and set/get fields to osg::Object to help
	  identify
	  which objects have values that vary over the lifetime of the
	  object (DYNAMIC)
	  and ones that do not vary (STATIC). Removed the equivalent code
	  in
	  osg::Transform, StateSet and StateAttribute, as these are now
	  encompassed
	  by the new DataVariance field.
	  
	  Removed MatrixMode enum from Matrix, and associated
	  fields/parameters from
	  osg::Transfrom and osg::NodeVisitor, since MatrixMode was not
	  providing
	  any useful functionality, but made the interface more complex
	  (MatrixMode
	  was an experimental API)
	  
	  Added ReferenceFrame field to osg::Transform which allows users
	  to specify
	  transforms that are relative to their parents (the default, and
	  previous behavior)
	  or absolute reference frame, which can be used for HUD's, camera
	  relative
	  light sources etc etc. Note, the view frustum culling for
	  absolute Transform
	  are disabled, and all their parents up to the root are also
	  automatically
	  have view frustum culling disabled. However, once passed an
	  absolute Transform
	  node culling will return to its default state of on, so you can
	  still cull
	  underneath an absolute transform, its only the culling above
	  which is disabled.

2002-04-11 17:15  robert

	* include/osg/Fog, include/osg/Image, include/osg/Light,
	  src/osg/Image.cpp, src/osg/Texture.cpp: Added several new methods
	  to osg::Image to help keep track of memory and added
	  osg::Image::readPixels to encapsulate glReadPixels.
	  
	  Reordering of includes in include/osg/Fog and include/osg/Light
	  to remove silly warnings under Visual Studio.

2002-04-11 17:13  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/lib3ds/ReaderWriter3DS.cpp: Patch to ReadWriter3DS
	  from Mike Connel.

	* src/osgUtil/Makefile: Backed out bad addition of NewCUllVisitor

2002-04-11 15:54  don

	  to it... Hm.. anyway this fixes it.

2002-04-11 13:53  robert

	* src/osg/DrawPixels.cpp: Fix for Win32 build.

2002-04-11 09:16  robert

2002-04-11 08:24  robert

	* include/osgUtil/SceneView, src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp: Fixed
	  refrences to NewCullVisitor which has now been mapped onto
	  CullVisitor.

2002-04-10 22:10  robert

	* include/osgUtil/CullVisitor, include/osgUtil/NewCullVisitor,
	  src/osg/Image.cpp, src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/Makefile, src/osgUtil/NewCullVisitor.cpp: Copied
	  NewCullVisitor over top of CullVisitor and then removed
	  NewCullVisitor.
	  
	  Added some defines to Image in prep for writing code to determine
	  how big a
	  pixel is.

2002-04-10 21:51  robert

	  osg::Drawable. Added osg::Image::readPixels to osg::Image.
	  
	  Made osg::LightSource to default to cullActive set to false to
	  that LightSource
	  nodes don't get culled by default.

2002-04-10 14:34  don

	* dist/PKG, dist/PKG/.README: Added placeholder .README file to the
	  PKG directory to keep CVS from removing
	  the directory on an update.

2002-04-10 14:32  don

	* dist/PKG: Removed big honkin' SUN PKG files from cvs
	  distribution.

2002-04-10 01:29  don

	  omitted) libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, libgif to makedefs
	  in the Linux section

	* include/osgUtil/SceneView: Added setProjectionMatrix and
	  setModelViewMatrix() methods to osg::SceneView,
	  and associated member variables. I have not linked them up to the

	  releted
	  classes, this work paves the way for making osg::Camera an
	  optional
	  extra rather than a requirement for rendering.

	  Added a cleaner way to install demo source so that installed
	  versions use a

	  Small fix to get osgText to compile with Solaris CC. Constructor
	  declared
	  with a non-const argument, but implemented with const argument.

2002-04-08 16:50  don

	  src/osg/TextureCubeMap.cpp, src/osgPlugins/osg/Texture.cpp: Added
	  support for setting the texture subload width and height within
	  osg::Texture. The values default to 0, and in this state they are
	  sizes of the glTexSubImage2D are taken from the source image
	  size. This
	  allows the previous setup with no settings for subload size to
	  work as
	  before.

	  greater debugging info can be gleaned.

2002-03-27 10:52  robert

	* src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Added support for VERTICAL_SPILT and
	  HORIZONTAL_SPLIT stereo modes.

	  with the OSG_USE_MEMORY_MANGER option which then uses custom
	  global
	  new and delete operators as well as provide osgNew and osgDelete
	  macro's
	  which add ability to log line and file from which calls are made.
	  
	  Updated osg,osgUtil,osgDB,osgText and osgPlugins/osg to use
	  osgNew/osgDelete,
	  and fixed memory leaks highlighted by the new memory manager.

2002-03-26 21:26  don

	* Make/makedirrules: Adding makedirrrules to Make directory

2002-03-26 21:24  don

	* Make/makedefs.new, Make/makerules.new: Temporarily adding
	  makedefs.new and makerules.new to keep them
	  separate from current makedefs/makerules files. Will eventually
	  remove all makedefs.* and makerules.* and replace only makedefs
	  and makerules with makedefs.new and makedefs.new

	  src/Demos/osgreflect/osgreflect.cpp, src/osg/Image.cpp,
	  src/osg/Makefile, src/osg/MemoryManager.cpp: Added
	  osg::MemoryManger which is currently based on Paul Nettle's
	  memory manager
	  published at flipcode. I havn't adopted Paul's macro's for
	  new/delete etc, but use
	  osg prefixed versions instead to allow greater flexiblity in
	  handling include
	  ordering.
	  
	  Have fixed a couple of new/delete[] problems which existed as a
	  result.
	  
	  To use the MemoryManager to track memory usage simply add
	  -DOSG_USE_MEMEORY_TRACKING to the compile line.
	  
	  Have yet to move the osg from using new to osgNew, will do this
	  next.

2002-03-25 23:13  robert

	* VisualStudio/Demos/osgtexture/osgstereoimage.dsp: Added missing
	  osgstereoimage.dsp

2002-03-25 19:04  robert

	* include/osg/Math, src/osg/Image.cpp: Fixes for MacOSX build.

2002-03-23 21:30  robert

2002-03-23 21:28  robert

	* include/osgGLUT/Viewer, include/osgGLUT/Window,
	  src/osgGLUT/Viewer.cpp, src/osgGLUT/Window.cpp: Moved the exit on
	  escape into Window, and added a virtual free method on both
	  Window an Viewer to clean up the windows, this is now called
	  before exit is
	  finally called, ensure that more more memroy is clean up prior to
	  exit.

2002-03-23 10:55  robert

	* include/osg/Texture: Added GL_TEXTURE_3D definition for those
	  with gl.h headers which don't
	  contain it.

2002-03-21 15:46  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/osg/TextureCubeMap.cpp: Added missing

2002-03-21 12:36  robert

	* include/osg/State, src/osg/State.cpp, src/osg/Texture.cpp:
	  Renamed have_applied_mode, have_applied_attribute, apply_mode,
	  apply_attribute
	  to haveAppliedMode, haveAppliedAttribute, applyMode,
	  applyAttribute to make
	  it more consistent with the general OSG name convetion.

2002-03-21 12:00  robert

	* include/osg/State, src/osg/State.cpp, src/osg/Texture.cpp: Added
	  osg:State:have_applied_mode(mode) and
	  have_applied_attribute(type) to make it
	  easier to specify which modes and attributes have been modified
	  without
	  the user requiring to know to what value, or to have an
	  equivilant attribute
	  to pass to the have_applied_attribute method. The original
	  have_applied(mode)
	  and have_applied(attribute) methods have been renamed
	  have_applied_mode(),
	  have_applied_attribute() as this was required to prevent the mode
	  and type
	  values colliding during compile (it was causing a compile error
	  when the method
	  names were the same.)

2002-03-21 11:57  robert

	* src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: _cullMaskRight was not being
	  initialized in the constructor which was
	  resulting in some sporadic problems when running stereo -
	  occoasionally the
	  right eye view wouldn't appear!

	  src/osg/TextureCubeMap.cpp, src/osgPlugins/osg/Makefile,
	  src/osgPlugins/osg/StateSet.cpp, src/osgPlugins/osg/TexGen.cpp:
	  Added osg::TextureCubeMap which encapsulates OpenGL's cube
	  texture mapping.

2002-03-20 14:03  robert

	* include/osg/Referenced, include/osgDB/ReaderWriter,
	  src/osgPlugins/osg/ReaderWriterOSG.cpp: Added a
	  Referenced::unref_nodelete() method which unreferences but does
	  not delete the object even if its count goes to 0 or below. This
	  should
	  only be called in special circumstances, the
	  ReaderWriter::ReadResult
	  being one of them. This new method has allowed the problem of
	  objects
	  being multiple referenced on return from readNodeFile() &
	  readImageFile().

2002-03-20 11:24  robert

	* include/osg/Texture, include/osg/TextureCubeMap,
	  src/Demos/osgtexture/osgtexture.cpp, src/osg/Texture.cpp,
	  src/osg/TextureCubeMap.cpp: Updates to Texture and TextureCubeMap
	  to clean up the code so they share
	  much more of the core texture setup code. This largely invloved
	  paramterizing
	  the applyImmediateMode, which has also been rename applyTexImage
	  to reflect
	  its functionality better.

2002-03-20 11:22  robert

	* src/osgUtil/IntersectVisitor.cpp: Added the fallback of
	  intersecting with the a drawables bounding box, if the drawable
	  isn't a GeoSet and hence supported by the IntersectVisitor's
	  GeoSet primitive
	  intersections code.

	  delete [].

2002-03-14 20:29  don

	* src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp: Fixed a problem for finding MIPS 64 bit
	  libraries. Was seaching for
	  LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY64_PATH

2002-03-14 17:34  robert

	  src/osgUtil/FlightManipulator.cpp, src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Integrated various changes worked on
	  at the Glasgow Science Center. Changes
	  include change the CameraManipulators so they work with double
	  for time
	  instead of float. Also added support for DataType to
	  osg::StateAttribute
	  and StateSet so that they can be set to either STATIC or DYNAMIC,
	  this
	  allows the optimizer to know whether that an attribute can be
	  optimized
	  or not.

2002-03-14 16:42  robert

	* src/Demos/osgtexture/osgtexture.cpp: Added a TextureCallback
	  which cycles through various filter modes, used
	  in testing new glTextParamters update functionality. I have
	  commented out
	  the call to attaching of the callback so osgtexture outwardly
	  behaves as
	  before. The code lies dormant just incase we need to use it for
	  testing
	  in the future.

2002-03-14 16:01  robert

	* include/osg/Drawable, include/osg/Math, include/osg/NodeCallback,
	  include/osg/Texture, src/osg/Texture.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/osg/Texture.cpp, src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp:
	  Changed Texture so that is use lazy updating on texture paramters
	  (Filter/Wrap)
	  mode by using a _texParamtersDirty flag in combination with an
	  applyTexParamters(State&) method which does the paramters setting
	  in one
	  tidy bundle. This new implementations replaces the CompileFlags
	  submitted
	  yesterday.
	  
	  Simplified NodeCallback by remove osg::NodeCallback::Requirements
	  as they
	  are no longer needed.
	  
	  Fixed comments in Drawable.
	  
	  Put guards around cosf definations so that they are only used
	  under Win32/Mac.
	  
	  Fixed warning in CullVisitor.

	* include/osg/Drawable, src/osg/Drawable.cpp, src/osg/Texture.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp: Fixed DrawCallback in Drawable and
	  added CullCallback to Drawable
	  Cull Visitor now checks for a Drawable's CullCallback and calls
	  it
	  if it exists. It then prunes based on the return value (bool) of
	  the
	  cull callback.

2002-03-09 10:54  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/lib3ds/ReaderWriter3DS.cpp: Support added for

	  within the cull traversal/draw traversal. The impostor code has
	  been adapted
	  to the new convention.

2002-02-13 22:56  robert

	* src/Demos/osgconv/Makefile,
	  src/Demos/osgconv/OrientationConverter.cpp,

2002-02-11 23:24  robert

	* src/osg/Matrix.cpp, src/osg/Transform.cpp,

	  Moved CullVisitor/RenderStage/RenderStageLighting across to
	  managing lights
	  entirely within RenderStageLighting, and changed the management
	  of modelview
	  matrices so that RenderLeaf now stores the absolute modelview
	  matrix, rather
	  than a model matrix as done previously. The later allows
	  RenderLeaf's to do
	  a glLoadMatrix rather than a
	  glPushMatrix/glMultMatrix/glPopMatrix.

2002-02-11 15:09  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/txp/Makefile: Fixed Linux hang of the TXP loader
	  by overriding the default -O2 optimization
	  level which appears to cause the code to hang, -O works fine for
	  some strange
	  reason, I havn't found any direct problems in the code. This may
	  be compiler
	  bug or a code bug, the bug may go away in later versions of
	  GNUC++, the
	  problem currently occurs under GCC2.96.

2002-02-11 12:51  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp: Applied fix to transparancy in
	  flt loader.

	  src/osgPlugins/tgz/Makefile, src/osgPlugins/tiff/Makefile,
	  src/osgPlugins/txp/Makefile, src/osgPlugins/zip/Makefile: Fixed a
	  make install error on the plugins related to the old definitions
	  for
	  plugin names hanging around despite being deprecated. These
	  definiations
	  confused the make install/make instclean so it tried to link a
	  non existant
	  library. Have removed old definitions and everything intalls
	  properly once
	  more:-)

2002-02-11 01:02  robert

	* ChangeLog: Updated changelog.

2002-02-11 00:51  robert

	  src/osg/ImpostorSprite.cpp: Updated Stats code, sent in by Geof
	  Michel.

2002-02-11 00:23  robert

	* INSTALL: Clean up INSTALL notes.

2002-02-10 23:19  robert

	* NEWS, src/osg/NodeVisitor.cpp: Updateds NEWS for the 0.8.44
	  release.
	  
	  Change the osg::NodeVisitor::getLocalToWorldMatrix() /
	  getWorldToLocalMatrix() methods so it do not initilize the matrix
	  being
	  passed to them, and assume the the users has already initiliazed
	  them
	  appropriately, such as to take account of camera positions.

2002-02-10 22:35  robert

	* AUTHORS, INSTALL, include/osg/NodeVisitor,
	  src/osg/NodeVisitor.cpp: Implemented NodeVisitor's
	  getLocalToWorldMatrix and getWorldToLocalMatrix
	  to allow users to querry the current accumulated matrix state
	  within the
	  scene graph.

2002-02-10 20:05  robert

	* include/osg/Export: Disbalbed a dumb warning in Windows build via
	  a #pragma.

2002-02-10 17:16  robert

	* src/osgGLUT/Viewer.cpp, src/osgUtil/DriveManipulator.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Fixed a bug in the drive manipulator
	  which was due to it using the local
	  coords of the intersection point with the scene rather than the
	  world
	  coord value for that point. The code now uses
	  osgUtil::Hit::getWorldIntersectionPoint() method for getting the
	  world coords.
	  
	  Added support for getWorldIntersectionPoint to Viewer.cpp.
	  
	  Put and #ifdef around the setting of the default display list
	  visitor so
	  it nolonger sets in under IRIX. This is a world around to the IR
	  graphics
	  imbending lighting info into display lists, if the display lists
	  are
	  created before state is set up it produces lighting artifacts
	  such as
	  flickering. Remove the the default display list init visitor
	  removes
	  these problems, display lists are then built on the fly and
	  drawables
	  a drawn for the first time.

2002-02-10 11:17  robert

	* Make/makedefs.macosx, src/Demos/osgbillboard/osgbillboard.cpp,
	  src/Demos/osgcluster/osgcluster.cpp,

	  src/osgPlugins/txp/trpage_sys.h: Fixes to TXP loader for Cygwin
	  and Ming builds.

2002-02-09 22:29  robert

	* src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Fixed the
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::FlattenStaticTransformVisitor so that it
	  does not flatten drawables which have double references to them,
	  but only
	  one reference with a static transform on it. This case can't be
	  flattened
	  but this wasn't picked up. The code now detects the case
	  correctly.

2002-02-09 21:29  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/bmp/ReaderWriterBMP.cpp: Updates to BMP loader
	  from Geoff Michel.

	  string refrences to solve compile problems under gcc 3.0.3.
	  
	  Also converted to unix file endings so other the windows style
	  files.

	* include/osg/Drawable: Fixed teh setDrawCallback so that it now
	  calls dirtyDisplayList() instead of
	  dirtyBound.

2002-02-07 01:17  robert

	* src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp: Fix for Win32 build.

2002-02-07 01:15  robert

	  include/osgUtil/Optimizer, src/osg/Camera.cpp,
	  src/osg/Matrix.cpp, src/osgGLUT/Viewer.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp: Various investigations into culling

	  lifted a new
	  implementation from sgl and it seems to work fine. Will need
	  further testing
	  but looks good.

2002-02-07 01:12  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/dw/ReaderWriterDW.cpp: Fix for the handling of
	  lighting in the DW loader.

2002-02-07 01:11  robert

	* include/osg/Referenced, src/osg/Object.cpp: Added a check to the
	  destructor of Referenced so that it detects referenced
	  objects that are deleted whilest still having a positive
	  _refCount, such
	  as when a object has been deleted on the stack, yet other
	  references still
	  exist for it. Have put the desctructor implementation in
	  Object.cpp to
	  avoid adding yet another file with only a couple of lines of code
	  in.

2002-02-07 01:07  robert

	* include/osg/Billboard, include/osg/Drawable, include/osg/LOD,

	  by adding a ComputeTransformCallback to osg::Transform, and have
	  now removed
	  the recently added AutoTransform since it is nolonger required.
	  Have also
	  updated CullVisitor to account for the new ways for tracking
	  transformation
	  matrices in the scene.

2002-02-05 21:51  robert

	* include/osg/Matrix, src/osg/Matrix.cpp: Have removed the old lazy
	  initialization of Matrix since it was causing bugs
	  and adding checks to many mothods which in the end slow it down
	  more than
	  not intilizing the code! The code is now simpler, more robust and
	  faster:-)

2002-02-05 10:49  robert

	  class now combines Cloner and DeepCopy into one class. Cloner and
	  DeepCopy
	  will be removed in next commit.
	  
	  Also have added osgcopy app to Demos which shows how the CopyOp
	  have be
	  subclassed to create users own specific handling of copying.
	  
	  Have fixed copy constructor problems in GeoSet which fix the deep
	  copy
	  problem experienced yesterday.

	  src/osgUtil/RenderBin.cpp: Added support for shallow and deep
	  copy of nodes, drawables and state, via a
	  copy constructor which takes an optional Cloner object, and the
	  old
	  osg::Object::clone() has changed so that it now requires a Cloner
	  as paramter.
	  This is passed on to the copy constructor to help control the
	  shallow vs
	  deep copying. The old functionality of clone() which was clone of
	  type has
	  been renamed to cloneType().
	  
	  Updated all of the OSG to work with these new conventions,
	  implemention all
	  the required copy constructors etc. A couple of areas will do
	  shallow
	  copies by design, a couple of other still need to be updated to
	  do either
	  shallow or deep.
	  
	  Neither of the shallow or deep copy operations have been tested
	  yet, only
	  the old functionality of the OSG has been checked so far, such
	  running the
	  viewer on various demo datasets.
	  
	  Also fixed a problem in
	  osg::Optimize::RemoveRendundentNodesVisitor which
	  was not checking that Group didn't have have any attached
	  StateSet's, Callbacks
	  or UserData. These checks have now been added, which fixes a bug
	  which was
	  revealled by the new osgscribe demo, this related to removal of
	  group acting
	  as state decorator.
	  
	  method

2002-01-27 20:28  robert

	* src/Demos/osgscribe/osgscribe.cpp: Added
	  stateset->setMode(GL_LIGHTING,osg::StateAttribute::OVERRIDE_ON);
	  to scribbed
	  subgraph so that lighting is always on, this is needed since
	  glMaterial is only
	  active when lighting is enabled.

	  wireframe
	  overlay of a model.

2002-01-26 14:13  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/flt2osg.cpp: Fixed the LOD center and range
	  code that so that the values are now multiple
	  by the _unitScale to compenstate for different scales in the flt
	  model. This
	  _unitScale had already been applied to the geometry data.
	  
	  Integrated new defaults for the texturing wrap mode, for when now
	  .attr file
	  is supplied with a flt file.

	  extensible via additions of new getLocalToWorldMatrix()
	  and getWorldToLocalMatrix(), computeLocalToWorld() and
	  computeWorldToLocal()
	  methods.
	  
	  Have updated the CullVisitor, IntersectVisitor and Optimizer to
	  use the
	  new osg::Transform::getLocalToWorldMatrix() which has the same
	  functionality
	  as the old getMatrix() but is now supports subclasses of
	  osg::Transform
	  transparently.
	  
	  Have added osg::PositionAttitudeTransform as subclass of
	  osg::Transform
	  which manages the transform as position and attitude via a Vec3
	  and Quat
	  respectively.

2002-01-23 15:42  robert

	* include/osg/Transform, src/osg/Transform.cpp: Updates to
	  osg::Transform to allow it subclassed more easily.

2002-01-23 15:28  robert

	* src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Fixed problem with
	  Optimzer::removeRedundentNodesVisitor which was removing the
	  correct redundent groups but for groups which had a single child
	  it was
	  was not using replaceChild to rettach the child to its parents.
	  It was using
	  parent->removeChild(group)...parent->addChild(child); which was
	  allow the child
	  to be attached in a different place than the original group, this
	  broke LOD code.
	  Have used removeChild instead which solves the LOD problem.

2002-01-23 12:04  robert

	* src/osg/State.cpp: Changed the ordering of applying OpenGL modes
	  and attributes back to the original
	  modes first then attributes since the it was cause a display bug
	  on some
	  datesets. It seems that the modes needs enabling before
	  glMaterial's
	  take affect, at least on the NVidia drivers under Windows and
	  Linux.
	  The OpenGL reference guide doesn't mention any dependancy so I'm
	  not
	  sure what the official line is. Some other OpenGl attribute and
	  modes
	  need to be applied in that order according to the blue book,
	  however,
	  drivers, at least the NVidia drivers seem require the opposite.
	  This may raise
	  the spectra of before and after mode applies, but this will
	  require extra
	  support in osg::State and osg::StateAttribute, and would have to
	  be handled
	  on a per attribute basis, and possibly different of each
	  platform. Yuck.

2002-01-22 19:30  robert

	* include/osgUtil/Optimizer, src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Fixed
	  FlattenStaticTransformVisitor bug which related to incorrect
	  handling
	  of objects which were transformed by multiple matrices at one
	  time - this
	  cannot be handled in the flattening process (since we only have
	  one piece
	  of geometry to transform). This visitor now handles this case by
	  disabling
	  flattening of any objects and transforms associated in this way.

2002-01-22 12:03  robert

	* src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Temporily commented out the call to
	  the FlatternStaticTransformVisitor to
	  prevent a bug in handling instance nodes. Will be commented back
	  in once the
	  bug has been solved.

2002-01-16 21:23  robert

	* src/osg/State.cpp: Reversed the ordering of setting of OpenGL
	  modes and attributes, so that
	  attributes are now set first, then modes. This is keep consistent
	  with

2002-01-16 12:03  robert

	* src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp: Changed hardwired char[1024] arrays to
	  char[FILEUTILS_MAX_PATH_LENGTH] and
	  defined the value to be 2048, this should avoid problems with
	  path lengths
	  which have been overflowing the 1024 limit (Sasa report this
	  bug). The

2002-01-15 23:21  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/flt/GeoSetBuilder.cpp: Changed the use of
	  std::vector<..>.begin() to &vector<..>.front() in code
	  from passing the vector contents to the
	  GeoSet::setPrimLengths(..) etc.
	  methods. This has been done to fix the compile under the MS .NET

	  datasets such
	  as sj_texgen.pfb.

2002-01-15 11:05  robert

2002-01-05 16:18  robert

	* src/osgUtil/TrackballManipulator.cpp: Moved the setting of camera
	  fusion distance mode into the handle method so that
	  it is updated on everyframe to ensure that switching between
	  Drive/Flight
	  and Trackball happens seemlessly.

2002-01-04 20:44  robert

2002-01-04 20:43  robert

	* src/osg/LOD.cpp: Added a guard to osg::LOD::evaluate so that it
	  returns -1 if the range

	  can happen
	  if a user creates more than n+1 ranges, where n is the number of

	  src/osgPlugins/lib3ds/matrix.cpp: A small bug fix to the matrix
	  dump function (it was primtiing out 5 columns
	  instead of four).
	  
	  Added support for multiplying mesh geometry by the matrix
	  attached to the
	  Lib3dsMesh structure, however this produces disjointed models so
	  have
	  to the default mode to bypass this multiplication code. Will need
	  to revisit
	  this in the future.

2002-01-02 10:59  robert

	  variables which were duplicated in osgGLUT::Viewer and
	  osgGLUT::Window, standardising on the Window ones, and therefore
	  removing
	  an unitialized variable that had been introduced. This caused a
	  crash
	  under WindowsXP due to send invalid values to glutReshapeWindow.

2001-12-31 23:16  robert

	* include/osg/LOD: Added a more detailed explanation of how LOD's

	  registering a camera manipulator
	  with the GLUT Viewer output as INFO rather than as a NOTICE. This
	  suppress
	  this message which was appearing on some of the demos all the
	  time, even
	  though are quite reasonable default behaviour is used.

2001-12-30 16:59  robert

	* INSTALL: Added references to sgv -stereo and sgv -stencil to the
	  notes of running
	  the demos.

2001-12-30 16:58  robert

2001-12-29 20:53  robert

	* bin, bin/.README: Added .README to prevent CVS from deleting the
	  empty bin directory when checking
	  out copies. This was a problem with the nightly tarballs.

2001-12-29 14:27  robert

	* include/osg/Transform: Added comment to osg::Transform w.r.t use
	  of GL_NORMALIZE when using
	  scaling Transforms.

2001-12-24 21:34  robert

	* include/osg/Light, src/osg/Light.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/dw/ReaderWriterDW.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/osg/Light.cpp, src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp: Fixed
	  the osg::Light so that it requires the user to explicitly define
	  which
	  OpenGL light is being operated on, and also now relies upong the
	  standard
	  osg::State handling of OpenGL modes to switch on the appropriate
	  lights.
	  
	  The previous static counter mechansim for the light number was
	  causing a
	  redundent light to be created when the osg plugin created the
	  first osg::Light
	  to use a prototype for other osg::Light's to be cloned from in
	  the
	  .osg plugin execution.
	  
	  The static count mechanism also prevent the lights modes being
	  controlled
	  independantly from the setting of the light paramters themselves.
	  This
	  meant that a light once created was global, and couldn't be
	  turned off
	  locally via the OSG's support for OpenGL mode enabling/disabling.
	  This
	  has been overcome with the new implementation, the user has
	  complete
	  flexiblity of when and where to use the different lights at their
	  disposal.

2001-12-24 19:06  robert

	  FltFile.cpp had a class and transient variable defined within the
	  scope of member function
	  FltFile::readExternals(), which was causing the IRIX 7.3 compiles

	* src/osg/Timer.cpp: From John Davis, a little addition to the
	  Windows version of the osg::Timer
	  constructor such that a static variable is used to force the
	  constructor
	  to check the number of clock cycles per second once, this means
	  that
	  multiple timers can now be created with incurring a the 1 second
	  delay
	  used for timming the clock speed every time the constructor is
	  called.

2001-11-30 20:53  robert

	* src/osg/StateSet.cpp: Fixed bug in osg::StateSet::merge(..) where
	  the containers were being
	  iterated from begin() to begin() rather than begin() to end().

2001-11-21 15:53  don

	* include/osg/Camera, src/osg/Camera.cpp: Small fix for
	  preprocessor _MP symbol clash with MFC.

2001-11-19 13:14  robert

	* src/osgText/Font.cpp: Made the Warning font file not found

2001-11-19 11:52  robert

	* include/osgUtil/Optimizer: Added DLL export to the internal

2001-11-15 11:59  robert

	* src/osgGLUT/Viewer.cpp: Move the call to the manipulators before
	  the scene app traversal to that

	  Updates to the osg::Transform, adding preMult and postMult
	  methods and
	  deprecating the old preRotate,preTranslate,preScale.
	  
	  Updated the rest of the OSG so that it nolonger uses the
	  deprecated
	  osg::Transform nodes.
	  
	  Renamed osgUtil::SceneView::setGlobalState() to
	  osgUtil::SceneView::setGlobalStateSet() so that the name reflects
	  its
	  functionality better. Updated osgGLUT::Viewer etc to cope with
	  new
	  name change.

2001-11-12 10:04  robert

	* include/osgText/Font, include/osgText/Paragraph,

	  error in src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp.
	  
	  Added support for nested NodeCallbacks, allowing them to be
	  chained together
	  so that multiple operations can be applied.

2001-11-10 15:46  robert

	* src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Fixed
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::FlatternStaticTransformsVisitor so that the
	  apply(osg::LOD) scaled the ranges in addition to transform the
	  center
	  point and children.

2001-11-10 13:36  robert

	* src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Fixed bug related to
	  osgUtil::Optimizer::FlatternStaticTransform::Visitor's
	  apply(Billboard& ) method which was apply the accumulated
	  transform to
	  the billbaord geometry when it should have been applying the
	  matrix without
	  the transform component.

2001-11-09 15:06  robert

	* VisualStudio/osgText/osgText.dsp, include/osg/Node,
	  include/osgText/Text, src/osg/Node.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/osg/README, src/osgText/Makefile,
	  src/osgText/Text.cpp: Added osgText::Paragraph which is a
	  subclass from Geode which composes a
	  list of text drawables as a paragraph block, handles breaking of
	  text into
	  individual lines automatically.
	  
	  Changed the osg::Node::setUserData so that the data type has to
	  be an
	  osg::Referenced, and removes the dependancy on
	  osg::MemoryAdapter. I have
	  done this since it simplifies the OSG side of the interface and
	  makes it
	  less like that the user might abuse the memory managment of the
	  data. It
	  does however mean that user data will have by subclassed from
	  Referenced,
	  and therefor may require users to have their own adapter to do
	  this.
	  However, this little nuasance is worth the extra cleaness and
	  robustness
	  afforded by going the osg::Referenced route.

2001-11-09 15:01  robert

	* src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp: Fixed the findFileFile routine which had
	  been broken by a fix of a dlopen
	  problem - './' was added to all files which which directly found
	  without
	  requiring a search path rather than just locally found files,
	  this broke
	  file loads which had wern't local but had a valid path. I have
	  moved the
	  './' work around to inside fileDSO and made it only apply to
	  Linux as I
	  presume this is all it was needed for. Don?

2001-11-08 13:50  robert

	* src/osgUtil/IntersectVisitor.cpp: Fixed the IntersectVisitor
	  which was broken by a recent patch to catch parallel
	  line and traingle combinations.

	* src/Demos/osgtext/main.cpp, src/osgText/Text.cpp,

	  Corrected mispelling of alignment is osg::Text and the osgtext
	  demo.
	  Added guards for divide bu zero's to osg::IntersectVisitor.

2001-11-06 11:36  robert

	  include/osg/LineSegment, include/osg/Math, include/osg/Vec2,
	  include/osg/Vec3, include/osg/Vec4,
	  src/osgUtil/IntersectVisitor.cpp: Added methods to support
	  isNaN,isInfinte and valid to osg::Vec* and osg::Math,
	  and added a guard to IntersectVisitor which uses these new
	  methods to prevent
	  invalid segments being added.

2001-11-04 19:29  robert

	* include/osg/Statistics, include/osgUtil/RenderBin,
	  include/osgUtil/RenderStage, src/osgGLUT/Viewer.cpp,

	  Integrated updates to stats sent in my Geoff Michel.

2001-11-02 21:20  don

	* src/osgDB/FileUtils.cpp: Fixed findFileInPath to prepend ./ if
	  file is in local directory. This was
	  needed by dlopen() for dso's in the current directory

	  to include osgText.
	  Also a couple of undefined methods in osgText::Text have been
	  added.

2001-11-02 12:26  robert

	* include/osg/Drawable, index.html, src/osgPlugins/Makefile:
	  Updated index.html with dependacy info about the new osgText
	  library.
	  Modified osg/Drawable::draw(..) so that it uses display list
	  COMPILE
	  rather than COMPILE_AND_EXECUTE to solve performance problems
	  under
	  NVidia drivers. The old behavior is still available by comments
	  out
	  a #define.
	  Fixed the default compilation list src/osgPlugins/Makefile so
	  that it
	  compiles by defalt png and gif.

	  bug was related to texel padding of the height not be accounted
	  for in texture
	  size calculation, but was used during populating the image data

	* include/osg/StateSet, src/osg/StateSet.cpp: Added a bool paramter
	  to osg::StateSet::compare(const StateSet& rhs,bool
	  compareAttributeContents=false) const;
	  to allow it to use different comparison schemes, now it can use
	  checking for pointer equality (the default)
	  or attribute contexts. This has been added to assist optimization
	  of databases within the flt loader, but
	  also could be useful for other operations too.

2001-10-23 15:55  robert

	* VisualStudio/osgGLUT/osgGLUT.dsp, include/osgGLUT/Window,
	  src/osgGLUT/Makefile, src/osgGLUT/Window.cpp: Added new
	  osgGLUT::Window base class which is very basic right now, all it
	  does
	  is bring up a GLUT window and provide virtual functions from
	  which users should
	  subclass to add functionality.

2001-10-22 22:02  robert

2001-10-20 20:26  robert

	* include/osgUtil/DisplayListVisitor, include/osgUtil/SceneView,
	  src/osgUtil/DisplayListVisitor.cpp, src/osgUtil/SceneView.cpp:
	  Added support for an osgUtil::SceneView::init() traversal which
	  is called once
	  per scene view. The user can attach a NodeVisitor to do init for
	  them, or
	  leave it to the default which is to use the
	  osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor
	  which compiles all display lists and texture objects. The init
	  traversal
	  is called automatically by the first call to either app() or
	  cull(), so
	  should not be called by user code during initialization. This
	  ensures
	  that a valid graphics context has been established before OpenGL
	  is initialized.
	  
	  osgUtil::DisplayListVisitor has also been updated to use a bit
	  mask for options, and the addition of
	  compilation of texture objects (via StateAttribute::compile) has
	  also been
	  added.

2001-10-20 09:48  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/pfb/ReaderWriterPFB.cpp: Added #ifdef to Performer
	  ReaderWriterPFB so that pfdLoadFile is used under
	  IRIX and pfdLoadFile_pfb is used under Linux.

2001-10-19 15:53  robert

	* src/osg/Lighting.cpp: Removed Lighting.cpp from repository, it is
	  nolonger used and was just hanging
	  around erroneously.

2001-10-19 15:30  robert

	* src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp: Updated the osgUtil::Optimize so that
	  the call to Optimize::StateVisitor is
	  #ifdef out under Win32 and STL port isn't being used. This
	  prevents crashes
	  due to MS's flacky STL implementation.

2001-10-19 14:22  robert

	* VisualStudio/osgUtil/osgUtil.dsp,
	  include/osgUtil/OptimizeStateVisitor, include/osgUtil/Optimizer,
	  src/Demos/sgv/sgv.cpp, src/osgUtil/Makefile,
	  src/osgUtil/OptimizeStateVisitor.cpp, src/osgUtil/Optimizer.cpp:
	  Added osgUtil::Optimizer which contains four visitor each
	  designed for doing
	  different types of optimization on the scene graph - state
	  optimization,
	  flattening static transforms, combining LOD's and removing
	  redundent groups.
	  The new Optimizer replaces the once seperate
	  OptimizerStateVisitor.

2001-10-19 12:56  robert

	* include/osg/Node, src/osg/Group.cpp, src/osg/Node.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/osg/Node.cpp, src/osgUtil/CullVisitor.cpp: Added
	  support for specifying whether view frustum and small feature
	  culling
	  should be applied to a node or its child with the new
	  osg::Node::setCullingActive()
	  flag. A mechanism has been implemented so that if child has its
	  culling disabled
	  then their parents, all the way up to the root are also have
	  their culling
	  implicitly disabled.
	  
	  The osg::CullVisitor has updated to take account of
	  both the explicit control via setCullingActive and the implicit
	  culling
	  disabling through children being disabled.
	  
	  This feature is useful for nodes which don't have a bounding
	  volume to cull
	  against, earth sky implementations and light sources.
	  
	  The default osg::Node::_cullingActive is true, i.e. culling is
	  enabled by
	  default.

2001-10-17 22:17  don

	* Make/makedefs.linux, src/osgPlugins/pfb/ReaderWriterPFB.cpp:
	  Fixed static libraries in madefs.linux and error in
	  ReaderWriterPFB.cpp

2001-10-16 22:30  bryan

	* Metrowerks/Metrowerks.mcp: Update the tree to my version of the
	  project file (I thought it was already in)
	  - Hang glide demo works
	  - sgv is still being fixed

2001-10-16 21:47  robert

	* include/osg/FrameStamp, src/osg/FrameStamp.cpp: Reverted Bryan's

	  compile under Win32 and IRIX. Will need to find another solution.

2001-10-16 21:32  bryan

	* Metrowerks/OpenSceneGraph.mcp: This was the old project file.
	  It's no longer used.

2001-10-16 20:56  bryan

	* include/osg/FrameStamp, include/osg/Timer,
	  src/osg/FrameStamp.cpp, src/osg/Timer.cpp,

	* VisualStudio/osgPlugins/png/png.dsp, include/osg/FrameStamp,
	  include/osg/Vec2, include/osg/Vec3, include/osg/Vec4: Fixes for

2001-10-16 15:03  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/lib3ds/ReaderWriter3DS.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/SmoothingVisitor.cpp: Fixed then normal smoothing
	  function in the .3ds loader and the
	  osgUtil::SmoothingVisitor so that unused normals at left at 0,0,0
	  insead
	  of being normalized, which results in (nan,nan,nan).

2001-10-16 14:24  robert

	* src/Demos/sgv/sgv.cpp: Completed implementation of a the new
	  CombineLODsVisitor, ideal for use with
	  the .flt loader. Code is stuff currently in sgv, but will be
	  moved out once
	  more testing has been done.

2001-10-16 10:04  robert

	* src/Demos/osgconv/OrientationConverter.cpp,
	  src/Demos/osgconv/OrientationConverter.h, src/Demos/sgv/sgv.cpp:
	  Added support for transforming LOD and Billboard centers to the
	  OrientationConverter and the flattenTransformVisitor in sgv.

2001-10-16 10:03  robert

	* src/osgGLUT/Viewer.cpp: Modified Veiewer.cpp so that when
	  toggling the light with 'l' the light can
	  be overrided to off and overrided to on, previoulsy it only
	  overrided to off.

2001-10-16 08:24  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/pfb/ReaderWriterPFB.cpp: Fixed problem caused by
	  ReaderWriterPFB::writeNode(..) not ensuring that the
	  file extension was .pfb. Have added a check.

2001-10-16 03:59  don

	* include/osg/Vec2, include/osg/Vec3, include/osg/Vec4: added float
	  *() operator to Vec{2,3,4} so we can pass Vec3's directly to
	  OpenGL glVertex?fv().

2001-10-15 15:50  robert

	* include/osg/FrameStamp, include/osg/Timer,

	  from Robert.

2001-10-15 14:29  robert

	* include/osg/State: Made the new global state attribute instances
	  in osg::State use osg:ref_ptr
	  to automatically handle the memory deletion.

2001-10-15 14:07  robert

	* include/osg/State, src/osg/State.cpp, src/osg/StateSet.cpp,
	  src/osgGLUT/Viewer.cpp: Added support for automatic creation of
	  global StateAttributes to osg::State,
	  these global attributes are created by cloning any attributes
	  which are
	  applied during rendering, the clone in a shallow copy, which will
	  set up
	  default valus for that attribute. This should prevent attribute
	  bleed
	  from one stateset to the next when the global StateSet doesn't
	  contain
	  an attribute used within the scene graph.

2001-10-15 11:18  robert

	* src/Demos/hangglide/GliderManipulator.cpp: Fixed rotations to
	  account to the fixes made to Quat and Matrix related to
	  right hand rule rotation.

2001-10-15 08:40  robert

	* src/osgPlugins/osg/ReaderWriterOSG.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/pfb/ReaderWriterPFB.cpp: The
	  writeImage/Object/Node methods in the .osg and .pfb reader/writer
	  didn't
	  have the new ReaderWriter::Options* structure passed to them,
	  which meant the
	  the virtual functions didn't bind with the new base class methods
	  and wern't
	  called on a write.

2001-10-15 03:32  don

	* src/osgPlugins/pfb/Makefile,
	  src/osgPlugins/pfb/ReaderWriterPFB.cpp: Updated pfb loader to
	  load pfb files into osg. Still broken for loading osg
	  files into Performer, however.

2001-10-14 17:54  robert

	* include/osgDB/ReaderWriter, include/osgDB/Registry,
	  src/Demos/sgv/sgv.cpp, src/osgDB/Registry.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/bmp/ReaderWriterBMP.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/flt/ReaderWriterFLT.cpp,

	  src/osgPlugins/tgz/ReaderWriterTGZ.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/tiff/ReaderWriterTIFF.cpp,
	  src/osgPlugins/zip/ReaderWriterZIP.cpp: Added
	  osgDB::ReaderWriter::Options class to the ReaderWriter base
	  class, support
	  for settings options in osgDB::Registry, and added the paramter
	  to all of the
	  reaader/writer plugins. The Options structure by default has an
	  string attached
	  for packing basic options, however, it also can be subclassed to
	  encapsulate
	  any users defined option data. In the later case both the client
	  code *and*
	  the plugin need to be aware of subclass, the plugin will need to
	  use
	  dynamic_cast<> to assertain its type.

2001-10-14 16:56  robert

	* VisualStudio/Demos/osgconv/osgconv.dsp: Added
	  OrientationConverter.cpp to the VisualStudio project files for
	  osgconv.

	* src/Demos/osgconv/Makefile,
	  src/Demos/osgconv/OrientationConverter.cpp,
	  src/Demos/osgconv/orientationconverter.cpp: Changed the
	  OrientationConverter.cpp's to have consitent captilization as its
	  associated header file.

2001-10-14 14:23  robert

	* src/Demos/osgconv/orientationconverter.cpp,
	  src/Demos/sgv/sgv.cpp: Fixed TransformFunctor code so that it now
	  uses the inverse of the
	  transformation matrix to transform the normal.

2001-10-14 14:23  robert

	* src/osg/Matrix.cpp: Fixed a bug in Matrix::invert(..) which did
	  not set full_realised=true,
	  so that one Matrices which had not previously be initialized
	  we're
	  erronously initialized later in the code resetting it to
	  identity.

2001-10-14 09:58  robert

	* include/osg/StateSet, src/osg/StateSet.cpp: Added
	  osg::StateSet::merge(const StateSet& rhs) merges merges the modes
	  and
	  attributes of rhs into 'this' stateset.

2001-10-14 09:57  robert

	* src/osgUtil/DriveManipulator.cpp,
	  src/osgUtil/FlightManipulator.cpp: Fixed the Flight and Drive
	  manipulators to work with the updated Matrix::rotate
	  code.

2001-10-14 06:01  don

	* include/osg/Drawable, src/Demos/osgconv/orientationconverter.cpp:
	  Fixed a small boo-boo in definition of bit masks in
	  include/osg/Drawable
	  
	  Fixed incorrect normal conversions for osgconv.

2001-10-14 05:33  don

	* src/Demos/osgconv/orientationconverter.cpp: Mr. O added fancy,
	  shmanzy C++ code, but broke normal transform functionality
	  Fixed.

2001-10-14 05:14  don

	* src/osgUtil/TrackballManipulator.cpp: Quick 'n dirty fix to
	  TrackballManipulator to get the rotations doing the
	  right things after the Quat fixes.

2001-10-14 04:50  don

	* Makefile: Cleaned up some 'make clobber' issues in root Makefile

2001-10-14 04:28  don

	* src/osg/Matrix.cpp, src/osg/Quat.cpp: Quaternions were assigning
	  inverted values during conversion to matricies.
	  This is probably due to an error on the gamasutra web page
	  demonstrating this.
	  It caused left-handed rotations rather than right handed
	  rotations. Should be
	  fixed now.

2001-10-13 11:16  robert

	* TODO, include/osg/Drawable, include/osg/GeoSet,
	  src/Demos/osgconv/orientationconverter.cpp,
	  src/Demos/sgv/Makefile, src/Demos/sgv/sgv.cpp,
	  src/osg/GeoSet.cpp: Changed the naming and calling convention of
	  the new Drawable::AttributeFunctor
	  and have updated GeoSet to use mutable values for the _numverts
	  etc, allowing
	  osg::GeoSet::computeNumVerts() to be a const operation.
	  osg::GeoSet::getNumVerts
	  is now a const once more, so avoiding compilation problems. Also
	  chaned the new
	  osgconv orientation code to use a Drawable::AttributeFunctor so
	  it can work on
	  other Drawables other than just GeoSets.

2001-10-13 09:48  don

	* src/Demos/osgconv/orientationconverter.cpp: Added Mr. Osfields
	  dynamic_cast<> and test for validity test.

2001-10-13 08:34  don

	* src/osg/Quat.cpp: backed out right-handed coordinate transform
	  for makeRot(vec3,vec3) in Quat.cpp

2001-10-13 08:32  don

	* src/Demos/osgconv/orientationconverter.cpp: A few more clean ups

	* src/osg/Quat.cpp: Changed some routines to produce right-handed
	  rotations.

2001-10-13 06:22  don

	* src/Demos/osgconv/Makefile,
	  src/Demos/osgconv/OrientationConverter.h,

	  development location

2001-10-13 01:28  don

	* include/osg/Matrix: Removed personal note in Matrix header file

2001-10-12 20:06  robert

	* src/osg/GeoSet.cpp: Added support for the new

2001-10-12 20:05  robert

	* include/osg/Drawable, include/osg/GeoSet, include/osg/Vec2,
	  include/osg/Vec3, include/osg/Vec4: Added != method to

	  commented
	  out the sort operation as Peformance benifit is currently

	  glMatrixMode( GL_MODELVIEW ); after the setting of the texture

	  #include's within the osg namespace.

2001-09-29 18:34  robert

	* src/Demos/hangglide/hangglide.cpp, src/osg/StateSet.cpp: Added
	  setAttributeAndModes(new Depth,StateAttribute::ON);
	  to the StateSet::setGlobalDefault() so that the correct default
	  for the glDepthFunc etc are set up for scene graphs, and allows
	  override of these value which risk of inheriting state on to the
	  rest of the scene graph.
	  
	  This has allowed the hangglide demo to be simplified since it now
	  doesn't need to set the global Depth instance itself.

2001-09-29 09:37  robert

	* include/osg/Matrix, src/osg/Matrix.cpp: Modified the Matrix
	  multiple method added by Don so it is safer and added comments
	  explaining why it shouldn't be needed as other more efficient
	  methods should be doing the work for us.
	  
	  Also added Matrix::ensureRealized() to support the lazy
	  initialization of Matrix, whilest keeping the implementation
	  robust so that external calls to Matrix which get values do so on
	  an initialized matrix.

	  src/osg/FrameStamp.cpp: 1) new implementation of the osg::Matrix
	  class. Note details below.
	  2) cleaned up osg::Timer, still in progress. My intent has been
	  to
	  pave the way for support for other OS's.
	  3) new osg::FrameStamp class which has a frame number, reference
	  time for each frame to be app, culled and drawn. The FrameStamp
	  also can be passed to other machines (i.e. cluster) and the
	  FrameStamp can be used with the slaves own app,cull and draw.
	  I've also added the beginings of a calander time data to the
	  FrameStamp to allow time or day and year to be used in setting
	  up position of sun/moon etc. etc.
	  4) The osg::State now has contains a pointer to the last applied
	  osg::Camera and the current osg::FrameStamp, so that drawables
	  can use both pieces of information for creating effects such
	  CLOD, earth/sky etc. The osg::NodeVisitor also now allows you
	  to attach a FrameStamp to support syncronization of actions on
	  the scene graph.

	  src/osgUtil/OptimizeStateVisitor.cpp: o Added
	  osgUtil::StateOptimizeVisitor which traversing the scene
	  graph and builds up a map of all StateAttributes and StateSets
	  and then removes the duplicates. This promotes state sharing
	  throughout the scene graph which inturn can significantly improve
	  performance thanks to reduced state changing. Particularily
	  effective on datasets where a great deal of duplicated state
	  exists.
	  o Added pure virtual compare(const osg::StateAttribute&)
	  method to osg::StateAttribute, and implemented it in all the
	  subclasses from StateAttribute. Added <,== & != operator
	  on StateAttribute and Matrix to support new StateOptimizeVisitor.
	  o Added META_Object, META_Node and META_StateAttribute macros to
	  Object, Node and StateAttribute respectively which define the
	  standard pure virtual methods such as clone, className
	  & isSameKindAs. Changed all the appropriate header files to
	  use these macro's rather define them in each header, these cleans
	  up the headers considerably.
	  o Corrected the implementation of osg::Light::getType so it
	  correctly
	  uses a unique type for each of the OpenGL lights (GL_LIGHT0..
	  GL_LIGHT7 relates to osg::StateAttriburte::LIGHT_0..LIGHT_7.
	  o Changed the definition of osg::StateStateAttribute::Type to
	  is now a unsigned int rather than an enum, and have changed the
	  name of the previous Type enum list to be Types. This makes it
	  more consistent with the difination of values found in
	  StateAttribute
	  and also easier to extend with having to cast to an enum.
	  o From Pail Fredrikson, updated Maitrx.new implemention which
	  uses
	  the same matrix orientation as the original Matrix implemention.

	  o New support for NodeCallbacks, via AppCallback attached to
	  osg::Node's, and a default osgUtil::AppVisitor which calls them
	  on
	  each frame.
	  
	  o Support for traversal masks in osg::NodeVisitor, osg::Node
	  which allows nodes to be switched on or off via a bit mask.
	  
	  o Suppport for traversal number (frame number) and reference time
	  into osg::NodeVisitor to handle syncronization of app and cull
	  traversals. This also assist clustering as traversal number
	  master to slaves.
